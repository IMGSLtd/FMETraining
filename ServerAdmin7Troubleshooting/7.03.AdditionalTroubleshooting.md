# Additional Troubleshooting #

Some additional troubleshooting techniques.

## FME Workbench-FME Server Connection ##

If you are unable to connect from FME Workbench to FME Server then the following suggestions may be of help:

- Check if there is a firewall running on either your computer or the FME Server. If so, you must open port 7071 to use Direct Connection or port 80 (or 8080) to use the Web Connection. A popular tool for checking ports is netstat, a command line utility on Windows, or telnet on Linux systems.
- Restart the FME Server Services. On Windows, go to Start &gt; Programs &gt; FME Server &gt; Windows Service &gt; right-click Restart and select Run as administrator.

## Web User Interface ##

If you are unable to access the Web User Interface then the following suggestions may be of help:

- Confirm that FME Server is installed and running! The easiest way to be sure is to restart FME Server using Start &gt; Programs &gt; FME Server &gt; Windows Service &gt; Restart
- Check whether FME Server was installed using an application server port other than 80. For example, if port 80 was already being used the installer might have used a different port; 8080 is most common. To check, try entering the URL with this syntax http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/fmeserver - for example http://localhost:8080/fmeserver

## Workspaces are Queued but not Run ##

If a workspace appears in the FME Server queue, but is never executed, then it may be because no engines are running.

- Check the Web User Interface (Engines & Licensing &gt; Engine Management) to confirm engine status. If no engines are available, check licensing and update as necessary. Restart FME Server once a proper license is in place.

## Workspaces Fail when Run ##

If a workspace fails when it is being run then the following suggestions may help:

- Run the workspace first on FME Desktop. If it does not work there, it will not work on FME Server.
- Data paths can cause problems when moving from a local Desktop machine to a Server environment. Check the dataset parameters (Reader and Writer) to ensure they are not referring to a local path that does not exist on the Server. You may need to change the parameter to use the Resources dialog (Browse) and not a file path dialog (Specify Location). File permissions and the service account used to run the FME Server Windows Services is commonly the fault.
- Check the FME log file using Jobs &gt; Completed in the Web User Interface. This may help to explain why there is a problem.

## Scheduling ##

If a scheduled workspace appears to have not been run at the expected time then the following suggestions may be of help:

- Ensure an engine is available, and that the scheduled job is not in a queue.
- Check the date and time very carefully to ensure the correct values were entered.
- Check the timezone is correct. The Web User Interface operates on local timezone, which is not necessarily the same timezone as where the server is physically located.

## Cannot Connect to WebSockets Server ##

If you cannot connect to a WebSockets server then the following may be of help:

- Ensure the FME Server's WebSockets port (default 7078) is open.
- Ensure you are using the correct stream_id for sending and receiving between your applications.
