# Partial Runs

A partial run is when only one section of a workspace executes. One way to do this is to disable objects in the canvas to just run certain enabled parts. Another method is to use a tool called Partial Runs, which is represented by pop-up options when a workspace runs with caching turned on.

The technique you use will depend on how large the workspace is, and how much of it you need to run. You may use one method or the other - or you may use both!

## Disabled Objects

If designed correctly, a large workspace should be made up of small sections. Isolating a section (or part of a section) for testing is possible by disabling connections to all other components.

An object (connection or feature type) is disabled by right-clicking it and choosing the option to Disable (or selecting it and using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>):

A disabled connection is inoperative as if deleted, and no features will pass through. Transformers and feature types can also be disabled. Even a reader/writer can be disabled through the Navigator window.

Here an author has disabled two connections (both from the Tester:Passed port) and two feature types:

With that setup, the top part of the workspace will operate up until (and including) the Tester. The bottom portion will not run at all. No data will emerge from the disabled feature types, and the Tester will not pass any data to it.

With caching turned on, the author can inspect part of the workspace without having to run the entire translation. This feature is a significant advantage when (like here) the disabled section takes up most of the overall processing time.

## Feature Caching

As covered earlier, feature caches can also be used to only run part of a workspace. In fact, we've been doing this throughout the module!

LIST BENEFITS?

{% import "../includes/templates.html" as template %}

{% call template.tip() %}

<p>A partial run is particularly useful in avoiding re-reading data from its source; especially when the data comes from a slow, remote location such as a web service.</p>
<p>Also, caches can be saved with the workspace when saved as a template. That means the workspace can be re-run using the caches from a previous session or even from another author!</p>

{% endcall %}
