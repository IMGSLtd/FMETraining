### 9.7 Data Uploads and Downloads

![](./Images/9.7.1.TestRun.png)

<br>
This exercise builds a web application that can accept a file to upload. Then, the application will run the file through a workspace to validate the file. If the file passes, it will stream directly to the map in the application, and a KML file will be downloaded. If the file does not pass, then no map will appear, and an HTML file will be downloaded with the results.
