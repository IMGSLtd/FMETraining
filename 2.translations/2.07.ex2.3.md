# Feature Caching Ex



# 1) Use Feature Caching

Let's use feature caching to inspect our data.

Use Workbench to open the results of your last exercise, if it is not already open.

**New workspace info**

Feature caching is turned off by default; you can see the magnifying glass and small play button icon in the top left of your toolbar:

![](.\Images\feature-caching-button.png)

Click the button to turn feature caching on, or go to Run &gt; Run with Feature Caching. Then rerun your workspace. You should notice a little green square with a magnifying glass filling up on your reader feature type:

![](.\Images\feature-cache-icon.png)

This icon represents a feature cache. The cache stores features at that point of the translation, and you can click it to inspect the data. This mode is useful for two reasons:

Click the green icon to inspect the data at that point of the translation; your original Excel data will open in Data Inspector.

# 2) Sort Table View to Check for Missing Values

Let's use the Data Inspector's Table View to see if we have missing values in our data.

STEPS

If you look through, it turns out we have two kinds of missing data:

1. Some records do not have street addresses, leading them to not be associated with a local area.
2. There are also two rows of missing data in between each month of records. You can verify this by scrolling down to find the gaps between each month (where the `Month` attribute changes from `1` to `2`, `2` to `3`, etc.).

We will remove these missing values using transformers in the next unit.
