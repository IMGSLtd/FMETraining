## Dynamic Feature Types ##

In all Writer feature types, the feature type name can be defined by an attribute (or string constructed from attributes). When a Writer is set up as dynamic, by default the attribute used is an FME attribute called fme&#95;feature&#95;type:

fme&#95;feature&#95;type stores the name of the original feature type on incoming features. It makes sense to default to this attribute because then all data is written to the same feature type as it came from, and we get an output that is a duplicate of the input.

However, should you wish, there's no reason why a different attribute couldn't be used, in order to define a different set of output feature types:

Here, for example, the author is using ZoneCategory to supply the name of the layers to create. 

### Schema Requirements ###

However! Changing the output feature type names is not as simple as that. Because this is a dynamic workspace (not just a fanout) the feature type names chosen must match a layer that exists in the source schema dataset.

Failure to do so will lead to the data being dropped with the following log messages:

What the author must ensure is that the schema used actually contains these layers. Then the translation will proceed as expected.
