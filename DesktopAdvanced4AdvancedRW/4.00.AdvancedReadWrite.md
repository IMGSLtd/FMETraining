# Advanced Reading and Writing

Even "basic" reading and writing - with the ability to add readers and writers of multiple formats, import feature types, and set a multitude of parameters - allow an author to construct very powerful data translations in FME.

So, when you master advanced capabilities - like web-based dataset, generic readers and writers, and dynamic translations - you will be able to handle even the most complex translation and transformation scenarios.

If there is a common theme to advanced reading and writing tools, it is **flexibility**. This includes:

- The flexibility to handle data in any location
- The flexibility to handle data in any format
- The flexibility to handle data with any schema
