# The Generic Reader/Writer

The Generic Reader and Generic Writer allow FME workspaces to be freed from format restrictions.

Where all other readers and writers are tied to a specific format of data, the Generic Reader and Generic Writer are not. The Generic Reader is capable of reading almost any format of data, and the Generic Writer is capable of writing almost any format of data.

In that way, a single workspace can be used to process different data formats without being specifically set up for that format.
