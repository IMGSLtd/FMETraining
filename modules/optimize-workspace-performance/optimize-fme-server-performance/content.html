  <span>Performance, FME Server, and FME Cloud</span>
</h2>
<p>FME Server adds an extra dimension to FME performance, that of scalability. In terms of performance, the item most easily scalable is the number of FME engines.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of engines supports a higher volume of jobs, and the FME Server Core contains a Software Load Balancer (SLB) to distribute jobs to the FME engines in a balanced way.</p>

  <p>FME Server is probably best-known for its web-based abilities; but it has huge potential in processing large amounts of data in less time by creating multiple jobs on multiple engines.</p>

  <span>Using Server for Bulk Translations</span>
</h2>
<p>By default, utilizing multiple engines is only possible when you have multiple workspaces to run. When you have only a single workspace and wish to process it more efficiently on FME Server, then you need to divide that workspace into multiple jobs.</p>
<p>To do so, I can create a parent workspace that divides my source data into separate parts and sends each to a different worker job using the <strong>FMEServerJobSubmitter</strong> transformer.</p>
<p>For example, I can calculate the bounds of tiles to be created and share the load over multiple server engines by running the workspace separately for each tile.</p>

  <span>FME Cloud</span>
</h2>
<p>FME Cloud is an installation of FME Server hosted by Safe Software on Amazon Web Services technology and used on a pay-as-you-go basis. The benefit is that you donâ€™t have to purchase FME Server, merely make use of it whenever you have a job that can take advantage of its power.</p>
<p>The key to automating this for performance benefits are the FME Cloud custom transformers available on the FME Store:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Advanced-2019/DesktopAdvanced2WorkspaceDesign/Images/Img2.028.FMECloudTransformers.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></p>
<p>With the FMECloudInstanceLauncher transformer (or the FMECloudInstanceController), I can run my parent workspace, have it automatically start an FME Cloud instance and run one or more worker jobs on it.</p>
<p>This way I can start a new instance for each job, or run several jobs on one instance, depending on the type of instance and how many engines it has running on it.</p>
