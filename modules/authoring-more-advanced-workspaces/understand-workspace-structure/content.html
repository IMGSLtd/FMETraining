  <span>Workspace Components</span>
</h2>
<p>A workspace is the primary element in an FME translation and is responsible for storing a translation definition. Think of a workspace as the container for all the functionality of a translation, which is stored in the following components:</p>
<h2 id="readers-and-writers">
  <span>Readers and Writers</span>
</h2>
<p>A <strong>reader</strong> is the FME term for the component in a translation that reads a source dataset. Likewise, a <strong>writer</strong> is the component that writes to a destination dataset.</p>
<p>Readers and writers are represented by entries in the Navigator window.</p>
<h2 id="feature-types">
  <span>Feature Types</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Feature type</strong> is the FME term that describes a subset of records. Common alternatives for this term are <em>layer</em>, <em>table</em>, <em>sheet</em>, <em>feature class</em>, and <em>object class</em>. For example, each layer in a DWG file, or each table in an Oracle database, is defined by a feature type in FME.</p>
<p>Feature types are represented by objects that appear on the Workbench canvas.</p>
<h2 id="features">
  <span>Features</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Features</strong> are the smallest single components of an FME translation.</p>
<p>They aren’t individually represented within a workspace, except by the feature counts on a completed translation.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">

<p>Each workspace can contain multiple readers and writers, each of which can have multiple feature types, with multiple features. They exist in a hierarchy that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Basic-2019/DesktopBasic3WorkspaceDesign/Images/Img3.009.TranslationComponentsSmall.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Basic-2019/DesktopBasic3WorkspaceDesign/Images/Img3.009.TranslationComponentsSmall.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>A workspace with multiple readers and writers might look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Basic-2019/DesktopBasic3WorkspaceDesign/Images/Img3.010.DemoWorkspaceSmall.png" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Basic-2019/DesktopBasic3WorkspaceDesign/Images/Img3.010.DemoWorkspaceSmall.png" alt class="image image-block image-center" /></a></p>
<p>This workspace has two readers (each with three feature types), and three writers (with one, two, and one feature types). Each reader and writer is a different format, and each has a different name for its feature types.</p>
