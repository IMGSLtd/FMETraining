## attribute, format

An attribute that contains data that is part of the format specification. Format attributes are prefixed with the format abbreviation, for example <span class="Italics">igds_level</span> or <span class="Italics">autocad_color</span>.

## attribute, FME

An attribute that is generated by FME when a source dataset is read. It contains information about the data that is used internally by FME. FME attributes are prefixed with "fme" (for example, fme_geometry or fme_color).

## attribute mapping

The process of connecting source feature type attributes to destination feature type attributes. This is how FME performs schema mapping.

## attribute transformation

<p>The act of restructuring the non-spatial component of an FME feature: the attributes relating to the physical geometry undergo a change that produces a different output. See <a class="selected" href="#Geom_Transf">Geometric Transformation</a>.</p>

## attribute, user

User-created information that belongs to a feature. The attribute may have been part of a source dataset or may have been created within FME.

## breakpoint

<p>Adding a breakpoint to a workspace connection tells Workbench to inspect the features at that location. Running a workspace with breakpoints is a useful way to debug a workspace.</p>

## canvas

The FME Workbench canvas is where users graphically define a translation. This definition is called a "workspace" and can be saved for re-use later.

## coordinate system

<p>Each reader and writer in a workspace is assigned a coordinate system. FME will automatically try to determine the correct coordinate system from the dataset, for formats that store coordinate system information (for example, Shapefiles). Coordinate Systems can be set in the Navigator pane.</p>

## custom format

A custom format is a workspace (reader) that can be used to preprocess data, as if it were a data format on its own. Once created, it will be accessible from the Reader/Writer Gallery.

## custom transformer

A custom transformer is a sequence of standard transformers condensed into a single transformer. Any existing sequence of transformers can be turned into a custom transformer

## database connections

<p>Database connections provide a convenient and secure way to store and reuse connection parameters to a database service.</p>

## Data Inspector

<p>An FME Desktop tool for viewing data in any FME-supported format for verification and debugging purposes.</p>

## Data Streaming Service

<p>An FME Server service that accepts and runs transformation requests, as specified by a workspace, and returns the results as a data stream.</p>

## Data Upload Service

<p>An FME Server service that allows users to upload source data or other files for running workspaces.</p>

## Engine

<p>The component of FME that processes job requests by running workspaces.</p>

## factory

Factories are core-level FME components. They can operate on zero or more FME features, producing zero or more FME features. At the user level, factories are used by transformers.

## feature

A feature in FME is an individual item within the translation. Typically a GIS or cartographic feature consists of a geometric representation plus a set of related attributes. FME can restructure either of these components. Features in FME have a flexible, generic representation; they have a basic FME definition that is unrelated to the format from which they originated.

## feature-based processing

FME transformers can carry out transformations on either one feature at a time, or on a whole set of features at once. In FME, we call this set of features a "group." By default, the group is ALL features entering the transformer. However, the "Group By" parameter in a transformer can define several groups based on the value of an attribute. See Group-By Processing.

## feature count

The feature count display in FME Workbench shows how many features passed through each connection. The display continuously updates as features pass through the workspace.

## feature mapping

The process of connecting source feature types to destination feature types.

## feature type (reader)

Objects on the Workbench canvas that define the schema of the data being read. Most importantly, they define two specific things: the layers being read from a source dataset, and the attributes that those layers possess.

## feature type (writer)

Objects on the Workbench canvas that define the schema of the data being written. Most importantly, they define two specific things: the layers being written to a destination dataset, and the attributes that those layers will possess.

## feature type

In Feature Type dialogs, this tab includes the name of the feature type, and other format-specific parameters that apply only to this feature type.

## feature type attributes

A piece of user-created information that belongs to a feature. The attribute may have been part of a source dataset or may have been created in an ad-hoc manner within FME. Not all formats accept user attributes and the ones that do sometimes put restrictions on it.

## feature type format attributes

Built-in FME attributes that you can "expose" or make visible so that you can set them to particular values and connect them to other format-specific attributes. These attributes allow a wide variety of special things to be done with formats (like setting line thickness, creating special entities, setting particular bits or bytes).

## FFS

The FME format shortname for FME Feature Store (FFS).

## .fme

## function

FME functions are core-level FME components. At the user level, functions are used by transformers.

## group-by processing

FME transformers can carry out transformations on either one feature at a time, or on a whole set of features at once. In FME, we call this set of features a "group." By default, the group is ALL features entering the transformer. However, the "Group By" parameter in a transformer can define several groups based on the value of an attribute.

## mapping file

<p>Before FME Workbench introduced workspaces (in 2001), all translations were performed using mapping files.</p>
<p>A mapping file (.fme file) is a series of ASCII commands that FME uses to run an translation. Mapping files can still be run through the FME Quick Translator, using functions and factories (instead of transformers) to process the data.</p>

## Navigator

## notification

<p>A message generated by the FME Server Notification Service.</p>

## Notification Service

<p>An FME Server service that pushes data to and from FME Server in the form of messages when an event occurs.</p>

## null

In general, avoid using the word "null" to mean missing or empty. For example, empty Excel cells are sometimes referenced as null values. Avoid using the phrase null string, as it can mean either null string value or empty string. The term null should accompany null values, null terminators, or null geometries.

## &lt;null&gt;

When describing output from a Workbench component, null should be spelled the same way as it is output. Currently, this spelling is &lt;null&gt;.

## NULL

<p>When used in a code snippet (for example, a SQL statement) or when referring to a NULL pointer, use NULL.</p>

## parameter

Any part of a dialog where you can enter or select information (for example, feature type parameters).

## reader

The component in a translation that reads a source dataset. A reader reads a single format of data, but can read any number of datasets in that format.

## resource reader

Allows you to insert a reference to a dataset to be used in the workspace. This reader will not perform any actual data reading, except when up-to-date schema is required at runtime.

<p>A task in FME Server that specifies running a workspace at specific times in the future on a repeating or non-repeating basis.</p>

## schema

Safe defines schema as the structure of a dataset or, more accurately, a formal definition of a dataset’s structure. Schema is similar to the term data model; however, FME schema does not generally include data model relationships.

## schema editing

Schema editing is the process of altering the destination schema to customize the structure of the output data. For example, renaming an attribute from the source to the destination.

## schema mapping

The process of connecting the source schema to the destination schema in a way that ensures the correct Reader feature types are sent to the correct Writer feature types and the correct Reader attributes are sent to the correct Writer attributes

## shortname

<p>An FME Server directive that specifies how long a job remains in the job queue before it is removed without having run.</p>

## <p>timestamp</p>
<p>(in log)</p>

<p>FME processing time is the amount of time that FME was actively processing (not how long the workspace took to complete).</p>
<p>The absolute start and end times often differ from FME processing time because non-FME processes, such as a database query, add to the absolute time taken without adding to the FME processing time.</p>

## Token Service

<p>An FME Server service that allows users to generate security tokens using an account name and password.</p>

## topic

<p>An FME Server Notification Service keyword that acts as the recipient of a publisher, or the origin of a subscriber.</p>

## content transformation

The ability to alter the substance of a dataset. Manipulating a feature's geometry or attribute values is the best example of how FME can transform content.

## geometric transformation

Reorganization, or FME's ability to channel data from source to destination in an almost infinite number of arrangements. This includes the ability to merge data, divide data, reorder data, and define custom data structures. Transforming a dataset’s structure requires knowledge of schemas.

## structural transformation

The act of restructuring the spatial component of an FME feature: the physical geometry of the feature undergoes some type of change to produce a different output. See Attribute Transformation.

## transformer

The FME Workbench canvas is where users graphically define a translation. This definition is called a "workspace" and can be saved for re-use later.

## writer

The component in a translation that writes a destination dataset. A Writer writes a single format of data. In general it also writes just a single dataset.

## writer parameters

<p>Writer Parameters control how FME writes the data. The Writer Parameters button is accessible in the Add Writer and Generate Workspace dialogs. Parameters are visible in the Workbench Navigator after FME generates the workspace. </p>
