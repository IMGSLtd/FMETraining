# Chapter Review #

This chapter introduced you to concepts and configurations regarding FME Server scalability and performance.

## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

**Theory**

- Job Routing sends specific jobs to specific engines.
- Job Tags are used to assign specific jobs, or all jobs in a repository, to specific engines.
- You can have as many FME Engines as you want so long as the host's CPU and memory resources can handle the number.
- You can change your database provider at any time. PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle databases are supported with FME Server.
- FME Server periodically clears out resources and job history records that are older than the specified age.
