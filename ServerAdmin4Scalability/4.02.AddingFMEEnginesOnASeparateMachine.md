# Adding FME Engines on a Separate Machine #

You can add processing capacity to your FME Server by installing additional FME Engines on a separate computer from the FME Server Core. 

The number of licensed FME Engines you can add is limited only by the hostâ€™s CPU and memory resources, which constrain the maximum concurrent request throughput.

The additional FME Engines can be of any architecture (32- or 64-bit) and installed to any supported operating system (Windows or Linux) - they do not have to match the specifications of the FME Server Core. It is important to note that the major versions must match - you should not install FME Server 2017 and try to add engines from FME Server 2016.
