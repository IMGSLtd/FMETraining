# Job Queues #

Job queues are a mechanism for sending specific jobs to specific FME Engines. The reasons for using job queues include:

- Sending jobs to an FME Engine in close proximity to a data source.
- Sending jobs to an FME Engine that supports a particular format.
- Reserving an FME Engine for a scheduled task.
- Reserving an FME Engine for quick jobs.

When you create a job queue, you assign one or more FME Engines to the queue. Then, when you run a job, you can specify which queue to handle the job â€“ this ensures that only the specified FME Engines will process that job.

By extension, you can also assign a repository to a queue. By default, all jobs are assigned to the queue of their respective workspace repository, unless another queue is specified for the job.

All engines and repositories must be assigned to a queue. If an engine or repository is not assigned to a queue explicitly, it is assigned to the Default queue.
