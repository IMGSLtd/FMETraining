# System Cleanup #

When FME Server is used heavily for a long period of time, a number of files can build up and use system resources. These files are either resource files (including multiple types of log file) or are job history records.

Both of these are cleaned up automatically by FME Server using tasks defined on the *System Cleanup* page of the Web User Interface.

### Resources ###

The resources cleanup dialog looks like this:

Notice that there are multiple types of logs and results files that can be cleaned. Each of these entries represents a task that is run automatically by FME Server from time-to-time. When the task runs and finds files of the specified type, that are older than the specified age, those files are deleted.

Should you wish to keep the files for longer than the pre-defined period you may either edit the file age setting (click on the task to open a dialog for this), select and remove the task, or simply disable that task.

It's also possible to set up new tasks that search for files and clean them up. For example, you might create a cleanup task to remove files that are periodically uploaded to a resources folder.

### Delete_Job\_Logs ###

The Delete_Job\_Logs cleanup dialog looks like this:

It's a lot simpler dialog than for resources cleanup because there is only one type of information to clean. In this case you set the maximum length of time that job history is kept for before being removed.
