# Running FME System Services under Different Accounts (Windows) #

By default, the FME Server Core, FME Server Engines, and FME Server Application Server Windows Services run under the "Local System" account, which may not have network permissions. You may need to run these services under different accounts that can read and write data to the FME Server System Share, particularly in a distributed installation where these services are installed on separate machines. 

For instructions on how to run the FME Server System Services under a different account, please see [current documentation](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Server_Documentation/Content/AdminGuide/Running_System_Services_Under_Different_Accounts.htm).
