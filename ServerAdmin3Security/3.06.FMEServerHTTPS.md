# HTTPS/SSL and FME Server #

HTTPS ensures that communication between the client and server is encrypted, so that if it is intercepted, the third party cannot easily view or use the information. For FME Server, you can use HTTPS to ensure that sensitive login information is not exposed.

When configuring FME Server for HTTPS, both Certification Authority (CA)-issued and self-signed certificates are supported.
