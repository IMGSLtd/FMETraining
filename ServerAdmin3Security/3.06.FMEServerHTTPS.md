# HTTPS/SSL and FME Server #

HTTPS ensures that communication between the client and server is encrypted, so that if it is intercepted, the third party cannot easily view or use the information. For FME Server, you can use HTTPS to ensure that sensitive login information is not exposed.

When configuring FME Server for HTTPS, both Certification Authority (CA)-issued and self-signed certificates are supported.  Wildcard Certificates are also supported.

<!--** SM: Need to consider expanding**
Add configuration topics for distributed environments where Core and App Server are on separate systems. The steps in the doc do cover this but the steps must be carefully followed as it is easy to move the keystore file.  In summary both systems must have the keystores updated with the imported certificate.
