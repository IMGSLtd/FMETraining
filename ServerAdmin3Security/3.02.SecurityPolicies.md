# Security Policies #

There are various sections of security policies that can be set for each role or user. While there are permissions that can be set on each individual item in FME Server, the visibility of pages in the FME Server Web User Interface are managed by the *Access* or *Manage* privileges.

### Run Workspace ###

Run Workspace controls the ability to - you guessed it - run a workspace on FME Server. The *Advanced* option allows a user to access advanced job directives and the direct URL to run a workspace.

### Jobs ###

Access to the Jobs page allows the user to view the jobs they have run, or cancel any of their jobs that are currently running or in the queue. The *Manage* option allows them to view the full Job history on FME Server and the ability to cancel any job, or remove any job from the history.

### Schedules ###

Schedules are one of the core functions FME Server provides. Access to each schedule can be controlled.

### Repositories ###

Repositories are a place to store and categorize workspaces. Each role or user can be given different permissions for each and every repository - download, read, publish, run, remove. Access permission is not necessary to run a workspace - only Run permission on the applicable repository is required.

### Publications ###

Publications are a subset of the FME Server Notification System. Different permissions - read, write (edit), remove - can be assigned for each publication.

### Subscriptions ###

Subscriptions are a subset of the FME Server Notification System. Different permissions - read, write (edit), remove - can be assigned for each subscription.

### Topics ###

Topics are related to Notifications (Publications and Subscription). Different capabilities – read, write, publish, remove – can be assigned for each topic created.

### Resources ###

Resources are files and datasets stored on FME Server. Different permissions – access, list, write, upload, remove – can be assigned to each resource.

### Connections ###

Connections are predefined logins to either web services or databases. Each role or user can be given permission to access different connections stored in FME Server, to create new definitions, and to manage in the FME Server Web User Interface.

### Projects ###

Projects are created to manage a subset of FME Server resources, for example - workspace, schedules, publications, and subscriptions. Different permissions - read, write, delete - can be assigned for each project.

### Dashboards ###

Dashboards offer an easy way to view FME Server health using the FME Server Web User Interface.

### Engines & Licensing ###

The Engines & Licensing page concerns licensing FME Server, managing the number of active FME Server Engines, and the number of connected hosts.

### Security ###

Granting the permission for Security allows the role or user to create, enable, disable, and remove users and roles, as well as configuring for Active Directory.

### System Cleanup ###

System Cleanup tasks are defined in the FME Server Web User Interface and help to manage temporary files and log files among other items.

### Services ###

Services are key items of functionality on FME Server. They are the different methods by which a workspace can be run and output data delivered. Each role or user can be allowed – or not – to use a particular service.
