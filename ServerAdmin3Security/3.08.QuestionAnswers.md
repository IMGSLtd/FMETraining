If I want one user to have a higher level of access to other users in the same role (say I wish to let an FME author be able to manage engines) what should I do?
<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">1. Simply select that user from the user list and enable the manage Engines & Licensing policy</span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">2. Promote that role to superuser status so that the user has a higher level of security</span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">3. Create a new role with the manage Engines & Licensing policy enabled and move that user to it</span>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">4. Create a new role with the manage Engines & Licensing policy enabled and add that user to it as well as the original role</span>
<br><br>Security policies can be set at both the user and role levels. While you can create a new role and assign the user to it (Option 4) – enabling the user to be a member of two roles – it is much easier to simply edit the permissions of the individual user (Option 1).
