If I want one user to have a higher level of access to other users in the same role (say I wish to let an FME author be able to manage engines) what must I do?
<br><br><span style="color:lightslategrey">1. Simply select that user from the user list and set the manage engine policy to yes</span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">2. Promote that role to superuser status so that the user has a higher level of security</span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">3. Create a new role with manage engines = yes and move that user to it</span>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">4. Create a new role with manage engines = yes and add that user to it as well as the original role</span>
<br><br>Security policy is set per role, not per user. You could create a new role (AuthorsWithEngines?) and move that user to it, but - and this is the point - a user can have multiple roles. Our author can remain in the author role, but also be assigned to a new role that allows engine management.
