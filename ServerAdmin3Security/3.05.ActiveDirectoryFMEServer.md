# Active Directory and FME Server #

FME Server allows you to connect to an existing Active Directory / LDAP server and incorporate available users and groups into your FME Server security configuration.

Once a connection is created, you can specify which user(s) and role(s) will be imported into FME Server - noting that their passwords and membership will continue to be managed by the Active Directory server itself. The existing users and roles on FME Server can coexist with those imported. FME Server roles can contain both System (FME Server) and Active Directory users.

Any number of Active Directory connections can be managed by FME Server - this means that you are able to connect to multiple domains.
