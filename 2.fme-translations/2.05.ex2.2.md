_Video covering schema editing and mapping_

<!-- Edit and combine -->
<!-- Take generated CSV -> XLSX, show manual schema editing, show manual schema mapping, show editing + mapping with AttributeManager  -->

Now that you created a workspace to translate the 3-1-1 data to `.csv`, your manager has requested some changes to the output data... Why?

The first step in this example is to rename existing attributes and remove some unnecessary ones.

<!-- update path -->

## 1) Start Workbench

Start Workbench (if necessary) and open the workspace from Exercise 1. Alternatively you can open C:\FMEData2018\Workspaces\DesktopBasic\Transformation-Ex4-Begin.fmw.

## 2) Rename Feature Type

FME creates a workspace where the destination schema matches the source. However, the end user of the data has requested parts of the schema are cleaned up.

Inspect the writer feature type parameters. Click in the field labelled Table Name (remember this label is format-specific and in MapInfo we deal with "tables") and change the name from `CA18COV1 - Service Request Loca` to `311-requests`:

![](./Images/Img2.200.Ex1.WriterGeneralSchemaEdited.png)

Now when the workspace is run the output will be named `311-requests.csv`.

## 3) Update Attributes

Now inspect the user attributes. They will look like this:

![](./Images/Img2.201.Ex1.WriterAttributeSchema.png)

Let's get rid of those underscores in the attribute names and add a new attribute, called Date, that we will supply values to later. Carry out the following actions:

|Name|Action|
|-|-|
|`Case_Type`|Rename attribute to `Case Type`|
|`Hundred_Block`|Rename attribute to `Hundred Block`|
|`Street_Name`|Rename attribute to `Street Name`|
|`Local_Area`|Rename attribute to `Local Area`|
|`Date`|Create attribute `Date` of Type `string`|

You can rename attributes by clicking in the Name cell and making your edit. You can add an attribute by clicking in the blank Name cell at the bottom of the table and entering a new attribute name. Alternatively, you can use the `+` button to add a new row.  You can give it the Type `string` by clicking the drop-down menu under Type and selecting `string`.

Once you have made these changes to the writer schema, click the Parameter Editor "Apply" button. The attribute list should now look like this:

![](./Images/Img2.202.Ex1.WriterAttributeSchemaEdited.png)

However, you might notice that the triangles next to the attribute names we edited and created on the writer feature type have changed color to red! We call these triangles **ports**; since they are on the left side of the attribute they are **input ports**; the trianges on the right side of the reader feature type are called **output ports**. You can notice the attributes we edited have changed color to yellow.

These colors are used to visually aid schema mapping and indicate the following:

- **Green**: this attribute is connected.
- **Yellow**: this reader feature type attribute is not mapped to any writer feature type; therefore, this attribute will not be in the output.
- **Red**: this writer feature type attribute is not connected; while it exists in the schema, it will not receive any data and therefore will not have any values.

## 4) Save the Workspace

Save the workspace â€“ it will be completed in further examples. It should now look like this:

![](./Images/Img2.205.Ex1.EditedSchemaOnCanvas.png)

## 5) Add Transformer

It is possible to carry out schema mapping manually by drawing connections between ports. However, let's use a **transformer** instead, which is a more systematic and reproducible way to handle attributes. Transformers are objects we add to the canvas to modify our data during the translation. We will cover them in more detail in the next unit.

There are two transformers we could use. One is called the [AttributeRenamer](https://www.safe.com/transformers/attribute-renamer/) and the other - which we shall use here - is the [AttributeManager](https://www.safe.com/transformers/attribute-manager/).

Therefore click on the feature connection (dark black line) from reader to writer feature type:

![](./Images/Img2.206.Ex2.SelectedFeatureConnection.png)

Start to type the phrase "AttributeManager." This method is one way to place a transformer in the workspace. As you type, FME searches for a matching transformer. When the list is short enough for you to see the AttributeManager, select it from the dialog (double-click on it, or hit Enter):

![](./Images/Img2.207.Ex2.QuickAddAttrManager.png)

Doing so will place an AttributeManager transformer:

![](./Images/Img2.208.Ex2.AttrManagerOnCanvas.png)

{% call template.tip() %}

For a great tip on adding transformers, see #5 in our list of <strong><a href="http://blog.safe.com/2014/10/fmeevangelist128/">The Top Ten FME Tips of All Time!</a></strong>

{% endcall %}

## 6) Set Parameters

View the AttributeManager parameters (either its dialog or in the Parameter Editor window). It will look like this:

![](./Images/Img2.209.Ex2.AttrManagerParameters.png)

Notice that all of the attributes on the stream in which it is connected will automatically appear in the dialog.

Where the Input Attribute field is set to `Case_Type`, click in the Output Attribute field. Click on the button for the drop-down list and in there choose `Case Type` as the new attribute name to use:

![](./Images/Img2.210.Ex2.AttrManagerEditingAttr.png)

In response, the Action field will change to read *Rename*.

{% call template.tip() %}

`Case Type` only appears in the list because it already exists on the writer schema. If we had done this step before editing the writer schema, we would have had to manually enter the new attribute name in this dialog.

{% endcall %}

Click OK to close the dialog. Now in the Workbench canvas window, you will see the `Case Type` attribute is flagged with a green arrow, to confirm that a value is being provided to that attribute.

![](./Images/Img2.211.Ex2.AttrManagerAfterEditing.png)

Repeat this step for the remaining attributes with underscores. After clicking Ok you should see the input ports on the writer feature type all turn green.

## 7) Create a `Date` Attribute

We added a `Date` attribute to the writer feature type, but it is currently not being supplied with any values. We could use several different transformer to accomplish this; there are often many solutions to a problem in FME. In this case, let's try to create the attribute within the AttributeManager.

Open the AttributeManager Parameters by double-clicking it or clicking the cogwheel icon. Go to the bottom of the Attribute Actions table and notice the last row is empty except for the text `<Add new Attribute>`. Click this text and type in `Date`. You might notice it appears as an option in the drop-down menu; FME will look ahead to your writer schema to help you find attributes like this. After you type in date, the Action cell changes to `Set Value`:

IMAGE

We can enter in the value for our `Date` attribute in the Attribute Value column. If we were to simply type in "January 1st, 2000," all of the features would receive that value. However, what we want to do is create a date attribute that combines (or "concatenates") our existing date-time fields: `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`, and `Minute`.

We can do that using FME's Text Editor, which allows us to supply more complicated values to a field in a transformer. To open it, click the Attribute Value cell, and then click the drop-down arrow that appears. You will see "Open Text Editor" and "Open Arithmetic Editor" as options. Click "Open Text Editor":

IMAGE

The text editor - as you would expect - allows you to construct a text value. It includes all the usual string-handling functionality you would need, such as concatenation, trimming, padding, and case changing.

The text editor looks like this:

![](./Images/Img4.016.AttributeManagerTextEdit.png)

Here the user is constructing an address string by concatenating various existing attributes with some fixed characters (the commas).

Notice the menu on the left-hand side. Existing attributes are listed here and were added into the string by double-clicking them. Also, notice the other menu options. Maybe the most important for text are the String Functions:

![](./Images/Img4.017.AttributeManagerTextEditStrings.png)

The Arithmetic Editor contains similar functions, as well as mathematical operators to calculate values for attributes.

Let's combine existing attributes to create a `Date` attribute. In the left-hand panel under "FME Feature Attributes" you will see all the incoming attributes listed. Double-click the attribute `Year`. Doing so adds `@Value(Year)` to the Text Editor window. When the translation is run, this code will take the value of `Year` for each feature. We can combine multiple attribute values together to construct the date. In this case we will create a [standard FME date/time stamp](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Workbench/!Transformer_Parameters/standard_fme_date_time_format.htm), but you could use the Text Editor to format your date however you like.

Copy and paste the following code into the Text Editor:

```
@TimeZoneSet(@Format(%04d,@Value(Year))@Format(%02d,@Value(Month))@Format(%02d,@Value(Day))@Format(%02d,@Value(Hour))@Format(%02d,@Value(Minute))00, local)
```

The details are not important here. In short, we are using the `@TimeZoneSet` function to add a [UTC offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset) to each datetime stamp. We are forming the datetime stamp by combining the attributes from our source data into a string matching FME datetime format: `yyyymmddhhss-UTC`. Our original data had single digit months, days, hours, and minutes missing the leading zero, so we use the `@Format` function to fix that problem. This new attribute will be easier to use in FME workflows.

Then click OK and OK again.

{% call template.tip() %}

Most FME Text and Arithmetic Editor functions come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tcl programming language</a>. If you do not want to type out code, most results can also be accomplished using transformers.

{% endcall %}

## 8) Run Workspace

Save and run the workspace. Uh oh, there is an error! If you look in the Translation Log window, you will see some red text:

<code style="color:red">ERROR |AttributeManager: Failed to evaluate input expression: @TimeZoneSet(@Format(%04d,@Value(Year))@Format(%02d,@Value(Month))@Format(%02d,@Value(Day))@Format(%02d,@Value(Hour))@Format(%02d,@Value(Minute))00, local)</code>

Let's filter the log to only view errors in order to get more information. Click the button with the red X that says "16 Errors" in the top right corner of the Translation Log window.

If you look at the second line of errors, you will see this error:

<code style="color:red">ERROR |AttributeManager: Failed to evaluate expression '@Format(%04d,<null\>)'.  Result is set to null</code>

It looks like we have some null or missing data in our source that is resulting in an error. We will inspect the data in the next exercise to figure out what is going on here!
