# Generate Workspace

Workbench’s intuitive interface makes it easy to set up and run a simple format-to-format ('quick') translation.

## The Start Tab

The Start Tab in FME Workbench includes different ways to create or open a workspace. The simplest method is Generate Workspace:

![](./Images/Img1.015.GettingStarted.png)

## Generate Workspace Dialog

The Generate Workspace dialog condenses all the choices to be made into a single dialog box. It has fields for defining the format and location of both the data to be read, and the data to be written.

![](./Images/Img1.016.GenerateWorkspaceDialog.png)

Red coloring in an FME dialog indicates mandatory fields. Users must enter data in these fields to continue. In most dialogs, the OK button is deactivated until the mandatory fields are complete.

### Format and Dataset Selection

A key requirement is the format of the source data. All format selection fields in FME are both a pull-down menu and a text entry field.

The text entry field allows you to type a format name directly. It has an autocomplete function that selects close matches as you type.

The drop-down list shows some of the most commonly used formats, so many favorite formats are instantly available:

Click 'More Formats' and a table opens showing **all** of the formats supported by FME.

The source dataset is another key requirement. Dataset selection fields are a text entry field, but with a browse button to open an explorer-like dialog for file selection.

Similarly, the Writer format and dataset are defined in this dialog:

## Feature Types Dialog

Clicking OK on the Generate Workspace dialog causes FME to generate the defined workspace. However, whenever a source dataset contains multiple layers, the user is first prompted to select which are to be translated.

This is achieved through the Select Feature Types dialog. As mentioned [earlier](/1.getting-started/1.03.fme-components.md), ***feature type*** is another term for *layer*, *table*, *sheet*, *feature class*, and *object class*. For example, each layer in a DWG file, or each table in an Oracle database, is defined as a feature type in FME. Only selected feature types show in the workspace. This dialog gives you control over which groups of data you want to use from your source.

Here, for example, is a Select Feature Types dialog where the user has chosen to include all available layers in the workspace:

<!-- Edit to tabular -->

Congratulations! You have just landed a job as a technical analyst in the Human Resources department of your local city. You will be working to manage and analyze the data they collect from their 3-1-1 Contact Centre. [3-1-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1) is a local phone number used widely across cities in the United States and Canada for citizens to call in and request services. Most cities also collect this data online now as well.

On your first day, you've been asked to do a simple file format translation. The 3–1–1 case location details data is currently stored as `.xls` files, one for each month of each year since 2009. These files are stored on the city [FTP server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol). In order to host this public data in a format anyone can access, your manager wants you to translate the 12 `.xls` files into a single `.csv` file covering the entire year.

We’ve outlined all of the actions you need to take, though FME's interface is so intuitive you should be able to carry out the exercise without the need for these step-by-step instructions.

## 1) Start FME Workbench

If it isn't open already, start FME Workbench by selecting it from the Windows start menu. You’ll find it under Start > FME Desktop 2018.0 > FME Workbench 2018.0.

If Workbench is already open, click on the Start tab above the main canvas.

## 2) Select Generate Workspace

In the Create Workspace part of the Start page select the option to Generate (Workspace). Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Ctrl+G.

<!--Repeat of Image 15-->

## 3) Define Translation

The Generate Workspace tool opens up a dialog in which to define the translation to be carried out. Fill in the fields in this dialog as follows:

<table style="border: 0px">

  <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
    <td style="">Microsoft Excel</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
    <td style="">ftp://webftp.vancouver.ca/opendata/xls/CaseLocationsDetails_2017_XLS.zip</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Format</td>
    <td style="">CSV (Comma Separated Value)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Dataset</td>
    <td style="">C:\FMEData2018\Output\Training\</td>
  </tr>

</table>

The dialog will look like this:

![](./Images/Img1.208.Ex2.GenerateWorkspaceDialog.png)

Remember, you can set a format by typing its name, by selecting it from the drop-down list, or by choosing “More Formats” and selecting the format from the full table of formats. For now, ignore the Workflow Options and leave the default of 'Static Schema.'

## 4) Generate and Examine Workspace

Click OK to close the Generate Workspace dialog. A new workspace will be generated into the FME Workbench canvas:

![](./Images/Img1.209.Ex2.NewWorkspace.png)

The list of attributes is exposed by clicking the arrow icon on each object.

## 5) Run Workspace

Run the workspace by clicking the run button on the toolbar, or by using Run > Run Translation on the menubar. The workspace runs and the log file reports a successful translation:

![](./Images/Img1.210.Ex2.LogWindow.png)

## 6) Locate Output

Locate the destination data in Windows Explorer to prove that it's been written as expected (don't forget the Open Containing Folder button from Exercise 1):

![](./Images/Img1.211.Ex2.JSONInExplorer.png)

For now, let's use Notepad to ensure the data looks as we would expect. Right-click on `CA18COV1 - Service Request Loca.csv` and choose Open With > Notepad. If you look at the top row, you should see the attribute names we saw under the writer feature type:

`Year,Month,Day,Hour,Minute,Department,Division,Case_Type,Hundred_Block,Street_Name,Local_Area`

In the next section, we’ll cover how to inspect the data using FME Data Inspector.

## 7) Save Workspace

Save the workspace. We'll be using it in a later exercise. Remember there is a toolbar save button, and on the menu, there is File &gt; Save As.

{% call template.tip() %}
  When a translation is run immediately without adjustment it's known as a "Quick Translation." Because FME is a 'semantic' translator, with an enhanced data model, the output from a quick translation is as close to the source data in structure and meaning as possible, given the capabilities of the destination format.
{% endcall %}
