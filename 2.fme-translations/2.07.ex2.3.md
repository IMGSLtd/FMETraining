_Video covering use of the FME Data Inspector_

In the previous exercise, we ran into an error in our translation. Let’s see how the FME Data Inspector interface works by using it to figure out what went wrong.

## 1) Start FME Data Inspector

Start the FME Data Inspector by selecting it from the Windows start menu. You’ll find it under Start > FME Desktop 2018.1 > FME Data Inspector 2018.1.

## 2) Open Dataset

The FME Data Inspector will start up and begin with an empty view display.

To open a dataset, select File > Open Dataset from the menubar.
When prompted, fill in the fields in the Select Dataset dialog as follows:

<table style="border: 0px">

  <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
    <td style="">Microsoft Excel</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
    <td style="">ftp://webftp.vancouver.ca/opendata/xls/CaseLocationsDetails_2017_XLS.zip</td>
  </tr>

</table>

You will see a table appear in the Table View window. The main View will be blank and will say "There is no geometry in this view." This is because we have loaded tabular data with no geometry. As you will see later, if we load spatial data like a map layer, CAD drawing, or 3D model, it will be displayed here.

## 3) Use Feature Caching

Before proceeding to find the problem that caused an error in the last exercise, let's look at one other way to open data in the Data Inspector. This method is used much more often than the one we just covered, as it is more tightly connected to actions taken in FME Workbench.

While you were running your translations earlier, you may have noticed little green squares with magnifying glasses filling up on your readers, writers, and transformers:

IMAGE

These are feature caches; the features at that point of the translation are recorded in this cache and can be inspected. This is useful for two reasons:

1. It allows you to inspect the data at any point in the translation to check that your modifications are appearing as expected.
2. It cuts down on production time by allowing you to use data from caches to test portions of a workspace, rather than having to run the entire workspace each time. We call this Partial Runs. This feature is particularly important when you are working with large datasets, web-based data, or databases, which can take a long time to read.

Use Workbench to open the results of your last exercise, if it is not already open. Feature Caching is turned on by default; you can see the magnifying glass and small play button icon in the top right of your toolbar:

If you still had Workbench open, you should have cached features ready to inspect. However, you will notice the icon is yellow, not green. This color indicates that the cache is 'stale'; either something else in the workspace has changed that means the cached data might need updating, or, as in this case, there was an error in the workspace. You can still inspect stale caches, but keep in mind they might not accurately reflect the results of the workspace in its current state.

Let's use the Partial Runs feature to generate a fresh cache and inspect it. Click on your reader feature type. Note that a tooltip appears above it with several icons. We used the "Open Containing Folder" icon earlier. You will also notice the next icon to the right allows you to open the data directly in Data Inspector. The next few icons are used for Partial Runs. These allow you to:

- "Run Just This": this option is only available on readers. It just runs the reader so you can use the cache.
- "Run To This": this option runs the workspace from any connected reader to this object.
- "Run From This": this option runs the workspace to any connected writers from this object.

IMAGES for each

Click "Run Just This" to run the reader and generate a cache. Since this reader does not have an error when it is run, after a few seconds it should have a green cache icon. Click that to open the data in Data Inspector:

This is a useful way to quickly inspect your data when beginning any translation.

## 4) Identify Problem

Let's use the Data Inspector's Filter tool to see if we have missing values in our data. Click the Filter icon in the toolbar:

IMAGE

This opens a window that lets us query our data to filter it. We have to fill in a Left Value, an Operator, and a Right Value, to form a logical operation. Check the box next to "Enable Filter." Then click in the Left Value cell. Click the drop-down arrow and select Case_Type:

IMAGE

Then click the `=` in the Operator cell and choose `Attribute has a value`. You can see we have many ways of querying our data here. This option will select all of the features that have values. If there are features left over, we will know there are missing or null values in our data. Your dialog should look like this:

IMAGE

Click OK. Now look in the Display Control window. You might have to drag the right side to expand it. Look at "CaseLocationsDetails_2017_XLS [XLSXR]." To the right of this feature type name is a summary of the Filter results: "(97325 pass | 20 fail)." These feature counts are links; if you click them the Data Inspector will select those features (rows in the table). Click the "20." The Table View will show the first selected record. A ha! It turns out there are two rows of missing data in between each month of records. You can verify this by scrolling down to find the gaps between each month (where the `Month` attribute changes from `1` to `2`, `2` to `3`, etc.). This quirk of our dataset means that our date values are not calculating properly.

We will deal with this issue using transformers in the next unit.
