What exactly are the entries in the resources cleanup dialog?
<br><br><span style="color:lightslategrey">1. They are simply shortcuts to workspaces in the utilities category that I can run on demand</span> 
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">2. They are simply shortcuts to scheduling tasks that run at the described interval</span>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">3. They are specific tasks that FME Server runs once a day to help in system maintenance </span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">4. They are specific tasks triggered when the system is low on resources</span>
<br><br>These are their own set of tasks, separate to anything defined as a schedule or utility workspace. They are run once a day and remove any specified file older than the set time. However, #4 is partially correct. When the system's free disk space reaches specified minimum levels, FME Server will trigger a critical level cleanup event, in which all enabled cleanup tasks are carried out; the difference being it will disregard the Remove Files Older Than setting.

The system cleanup tools will erase any data uploaded like this when it is more than a day old. But which cleanup task is it that will do so?
<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">1. Delete&#95;DataUpload&#95;Files</span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">2. Delete&#95;EngineResults&#95;Files</span>

If I want one user to have a higher level of access to other users in the same role (say I wish to let an FME author be able to manage engines) what must I do?
<br><br><span style="color:lightslategrey">1. Simply select that user from the user list and set the manage engine policy to yes</span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">2. Promote that role to superuser status so that the user has a higher level of security</span>
<br><span style="color:lightslategrey">3. Create a new role with manage engines = yes and move that user to it</span>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">4. Create a new role with manage engines = yes and add that user to it as well as the original role</span>
<br><br>Security policy is set per role, not per user. You could create a new role (AuthorsWithEngines?) and move that user to it, but - and this is the point - a user can have multiple roles. Our author can remain in the author role, but also be assigned to a new role that allows engine management.
