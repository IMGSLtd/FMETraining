##FME Server Superuser##
The FME Server Superuser shares duties and responsibilities with the FME Server Admin, but has additional or elevated permissions for some features in FME Server related to licensing and security, and "backup and restore" processes For a medium-sized organization, there are one or few FME Server Superusers.


**By default the 2019 installations come with the user Admin and password Admin with the fmesuperuser role. This account allows you to get started setting up FME Server after installation, but should be changed after you have configured the server for users.**

**FMESuperUser and Active Directory**
It is not possible to map an Active Directory user account or security group to this role in the same manner as other roles. Here is how to enable fmesuperuser privileges with Active Directory:

Open the FME Server configuration file, fmeCommonConfig.txt, located in the Server subdirectory of your FME Server install directory.
Under the Security Management heading, locate the following line :
SECURITY_SUPERUSER_ROLE=fmesuperuser
And replace fmesuperuser with the Active Directory distinguished name (DN) of the user account or security group that should have fmesuperuser privileges.

SECURITY_SUPERUSER_ROLE=CN=<username_or_groupname>,OU=<organizationunit>,<...>,DC=<mydomain>,DC=<com>

Note: Syntax is case-sensitive.

Restart FME Server. All the users who are part of the specified Active Directory security group now have fmesuperuser privileges.
