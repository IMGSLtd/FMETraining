# Exercise: Backup and Migration #

Your organization has decided to upgrade FME Server to the just released new version. You want to make sure all the configurations, settings, and resources you have made to the current FME Server you have running transfer over to the new FME Server. By backing up your current FME Server and then migrating the configurations and settings to the new version you will save lots of time not making all those changes manually.

The first step for your migration of FME Server is to backup your current FME Server configurations.

1) On the Web UI, click **Backup & Restore**.

2) On the *Backup* page, enter a file name (such as Backup2017) and select the *Backup To* method to be **Download**.

3) Click the **Download** button to download and save the file.

4) It is also a good idea to manually back up the FME Server configuration files to a location outside of your FME Server installation directory for referencing them later on. Certain configurations are not included in the primary backup procedure and you will need to configure the old files with the new files.
