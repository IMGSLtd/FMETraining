# Exercise: Backup and Migration #

Your organization has decided to upgrade FME Server to the just released new version. You want to make sure all the configurations, settings, and resources you have made to the current FME Server you have running transfer over to the new FME Server. By backing up your current FME Server and then migrating the configurations and settings to the new version you will save lots of time not making all those changes manually.

The first step for your migration of FME Server is to backup your current FME Server configurations.
