# Backup Configuration Files #

To backup the configuration of your FME Server repositories, notifications, schedules, security, and services, use the **Backup** tool on the *Backup & Restore* page of the FME Server Web User Interface.

You can backup a FME Server configuration to either:

- Resource location, or
- On to your local system.

If you backup FME Server, do not just replace the restored FME Server configuration files with the backup configuration files. The structure of the configuration files may change between releases, so you should go through the old configuration file and the new configuration file together and replace the old configurations as you come across them.
