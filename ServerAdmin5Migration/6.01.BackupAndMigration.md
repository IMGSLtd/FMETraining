# Backup and Migration #

To migrate the configuration of an FME Server instance to another instance, perform a backup and restore operation using the tools on the *Backup & Restore* page of the FME Server Web User Interface.

Make sure to manually back up the FME Server configuration files to a location outside of your FME Server installation directory in case you need to refer to them later. These configurations are not included in the primary backup procedure. 

### Which FME Server Configuration Components are Migrated? ###

The following components of your FME Server are migrated:

- Repositories and the items stored in them, including workspaces, custom transformers, custom formats, templates, and resources. Any designations by users of a repository item as a ‘favorite’ are also migrated.
- FME Server Services.
- Notifications components, including Topics, Subscriptions, and Publications.
- Security configuration, including Users, Roles, and tokens.
- Schedules.
- Resources, which include the following:
	-	Resources whose definitions and files are both stored with FME Server, and are configured for migration. By default, the DATA, ENGINE, and DASHBOARD Resources are configured for migration. To determine if your resource folders are migratable, open the FME Server configuration file located at *C:\Program Files\FMEServer\Server\fmeServerConfig.txt*. Locate your resources under *FME SERVER SETTINGS START > Shared Resource Management*. Resources with a *SHAREDRESOURCE\_ISMIGRATABLE\_\** value of TRUE are migratable.
	- Online resources whose definitions are only stored with FME Server, but whose files are stored outside FME Server. In the current version of FME Server, these resources are limited to any Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 bucket connections that are defined. Only connection definitions are migrated (such as bucket names and authentication parameters). The files contained within S3 buckets are not stored on FME Server.
- Database Connections and Web Connections.

Resource folders containing large amounts of data require considerable time to back up, and result in large configuration files. It is recommended that you define large folders as non-migratable. Following backup and restore, manually migrate these folders to the new FME Server. Alternatively, host big data on a UNC path, then point the new FME Server to that path.

### Performing a Scheduled Backup of an FME Server Configuration ###

A workspace is provided with FME Server that can be scheduled to perform a backup of the FME Server configuration to an FME Feature Store (FFS) file. The configuration backup includes repositories, services, notifications, security settings and schedules.
