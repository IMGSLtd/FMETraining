# Data Download Service

The Data Download service is the key tool for Self-Serve setups, where users are selecting their own choice of data to download. It operates in a different way to simply running a workspace. 

When you run a workspace with the Job Submitter service the data is written to the location specified by the workspace; for example a file, directory, or database.

The Data Download service instead writes the output to a zip file and presents the user with a link to that file. This makes it ideal for self-serve, because the data is delivered directly to the user.


## Creating and Using a Data Download Service ##

A workspace becomes available for data download use when the author registers it against the Data Download service when publishing it to FME Server:

Once registered this way, Data Download options become available in the FME Server Web interface for that particular workspace:

The results of the workspace are not written to a specific output location; instead they are delivered to the user in the form of a hyperlink to a zipped dataset:
