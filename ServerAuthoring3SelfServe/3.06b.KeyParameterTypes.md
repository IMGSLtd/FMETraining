## Key Parameter Types ##

There are multiple types of parameter, mainly related to the data type required; for example integer, float, string. However, two key parameter types for a self-serve setup are "Choice with Alias" and "Scripted".


### Choice with Alias ###

Choice with Alias parameters are where the user is presented with a choice, each of which returns a different value to FME.

For example, here the author wishes the user to select the height of labels to be created in the output dataset.

The user is presented with the list of (more intuitive) options on the right, but the value returned to FME will be the (more useful) number on the left.

This parameter type is also very useful for some Data Download specific tasks, as weâ€™ll see shortly.


### Scripted ###

Scripted parameters are a way to incorporate a Python or Tcl script into the generation of a parameter value.

This script can include references to other user parameters, meaning one parameter value can be calculated based on the value of another. Parameters referred to in the scripts are generally published parameters that accept input from the user.

So, user input can be accepted from one parameter, and this input processed using a script, in order to produce the actual information required by the workspace.
