Your manager has some more requests for your workspace. City planners are undertaking strategic planning and want to know which local planning areas will need additional resources. They have sent you an Excel summary table of the 3-1-1 requests and have asked you to join it to a map of the local planning areas. They also want a copy of the original data with the edited schema. In this exercise, you will look for a transformer to join the summary table to mapping data.

Use the resources available (Transformer Gallery in Workbench, [Transformer Gallery online](https://www.safe.com/transformers/), the [FME Transformer Reference Guide](http://cdn.safe.com/resources/fme/FME-Transformer-Reference-Guide.pdf), and Quick Add search) to find a transformer to join two streams of features. Then we'll go through the steps to add it.

A join combines datasets based on a common attribute, or key.

OK, go for it! When you have found your solution, go to the next page to check your answer.

If you want some additional hints, click below:

{% collapse title="Hint 1" %}

The transformer is in the Filters and Joins category of the [Transformer Gallery](https://www.safe.com/transformers/).

{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse title="Hint 2" %}

The transformer you are looking for has Joiner in the name.

{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse title="Hint 3" %}

While several transformers will work for this use-case, we want to carry out an SQL-style **join** of our **features**.

{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse title="Hint 4" %}

You might have found the [FeatureMerger](https://www.safe.com/transformers/feature-merger/) or the [DatabaseJoiner](https://www.safe.com/transformers/database-joiner/); these transformers could be used in this case, but we are actually looking for a different one that works better.
