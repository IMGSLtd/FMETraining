<br>The Display Control window shows a number of different layers in the VancouverNeighborhoods dataset. In reality, most of these layers are extra information; the layer we are interested in is called Neighborhoods.

Click the symbology icon for the Neighborhoods data in the Display Control window:

Set the color to be a neutral shade (like orange) and increase the opacity value to 0.8:

{% include "../includes/SetDrawOrder.md" %}

<br>The previous change makes it clear that the zone features are below the neighborhoods in the drawing order. To solve this problem drag the Zones dataset above the VancouverNeighborhoods dataset in the Display Control Window.

At the same time set a color for the zones data fill color and reduce the opacity value to 0.1. The main view will now look like this:

<br>**7) Set Background**
<br>When inspecting data it will help to have a background map to provide a sense of location. The FME Data Inspector is capable of displaying a backdrop from several different mapping services.

Select Tools > FME Options from the menubar. In the Background Map section, select a background map format. If you have an account with a specific provider, please feel free to use that. Otherwise, select Stamen Maps:

Click the Parameters button. A map constraint (type) dialog will open. Click the browse button and select "terrain":

Click OK and OK again to close these dialogs. A background map is added to the display. Notice that the data is reprojected to match the coordinate system of the chosen background. For example, the Stamen Maps background causes the data to reproject to Spherical Mercator, with a clear change of shape:
