# Changing Database Provider for FME Server Database #

If you want to change the database provider for your FME Server database, you can do so by performing an “in-place” backup and restore procedure:

1. Backup your FME Server configuration.
2. Configure the new database server.
3. Update the database connection settings in the FME common configuration file.
4. Restore your FME Server configuration.
5. Remove dependency, disable, and stop the previous database service.

FME Server supports PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle databases.
