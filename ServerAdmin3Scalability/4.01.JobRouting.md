# Job Routing #

Job Routing is a mechanism for sending specific jobs to specific FME Engines. The reasons for doing this include:

- Sending jobs to an FME Engine in close proximity to a data source.
- Sending jobs to an FME Engine that supports a particular format.
- Reserving a FME Engine for a scheduled task.
- Reserving a FME Engine for quick jobs.

Job routing uses *tags* to assign jobs to a subset of available FME Engines. With tags, you can associate specific jobs with certain engines, or associate all jobs in a repository with certain engines.
