# Adding FME Engines on a Separate Machine #

You can add processing capacity to your FME Server by installing additional FME Engines on a separate computer from the FME Server Core. 

The number of licensed FME Engines you can add is limited only by the hostâ€™s CPU and memory resources, which constrain the maximum concurrent request throughput.
