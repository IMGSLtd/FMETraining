# FME Workbench

Let's take a closer look at FME Workbench. If you haven't started it yet, locate Workbench in the Windows start menu:

## Major Components of FME Workbench ##

The FME Workbench user interface has a number of major components:

![](./Images/Img1.006.WorkbenchInterface.png)

### Canvas ###
As we've seen, the FME Workbench canvas is where to define a translation. It is the primary window within Workbench:

![](./Images/Img1.007.WorkbenchCanvas.png)

By default the workspace reads from left to right; data source on the left, transformation tools in the center, and data destination on the right. Connections between each item represent the flow of data and may branch in different directions, merge together, or both.

### Menu/Toolbar ###
The menu bar and toolbar contain a number of tools: for example, tools for navigating around the Workbench canvas, controlling administrative tasks, and adding or removing readers/writers:

### Navigator ###
The Navigator window is a structured list of parameters that represent and control all of the components of a translation:

### Transformer Gallery ###
The transformer gallery is a tool for the location and selection of FME transformation tools.

The number of transformers (above, 484) will vary depending on the version of FME and any optional custom transformers installed:

### Translation Log ###
The translation log reports on translations and other actions. Information includes any warning or error messages, translation status, length of translation, and the number of features processed:

### Parameter Editor Window ###
The Parameter Editor window is for editing parameters for objects on the canvas window:

# Exercise

<!-- Adapted from DesktopBasic\Basics-Ex2-Complete.fmw -->

{% import "../includes/templates.html" as template %}

<!-- Change to CSV to Excel or something -->

{{ template.exercise(1,
               "Opening and Running a Workspace",
               "Libraries (Esri Geodatabase)<br>Roads (AutoCAD DWG)",
               "To open and run an FME workspace to explore what it can do with data",

}}

Rather than trying to explain what FME is and does, let's try it for ourselves! In this exercise you will open a completed FME workspace, explore it, run it, and look at the output. This example makes use of some slightly more advanced FME functionality, including the use of spatial data, showcasing what FME can do. When we begin to build workspaces in the next exercise, we'll start simply.

**1) Locate Workspace File**
<br>When translations and transformations are defined in FME, they can be saved in a .fmw file.

Using a file explorer, browse to the file listed above:

![](./Images/Img1.200.Ex1.LocateWorkspace.png)

Double-click on the file. It will open an application called FME Workbench.


<br>**2) Explore FME Workspace**
<br>In FME Workbench, dismiss any Getting Started dialog that may open by clicking "Don't Show Me Again."

The main part of the application will look like this:

![](./Images/Img1.201.Ex1.OpenedWorkspace.png)

This part we call the canvas. It is where the translation and transformation of data is defined graphically. Although it might look complicated, it does not take much practice with FME to create workflows of this type.

Examine the left-hand side of the canvas:

![](./Images/Img1.202.Ex1.BookmarkedReader.png)

This area is where we read data, in this case, a table of libraries from an Esri Geodatabase. It is the "E" (Extract) part of ETL.

Now look at the right-hand side:

![](./Images/Img1.203.Ex1.BookmarkedWriter.png)

This area is where we write data, in this case, a report of the libraries in HTML format. It is the "L" (Load) part of ETL.

In between the reader and writer are objects that transform data. They represent the "T" (Transform) part of ETL.

Labels and other annotations show us what the workspace does. It:

- Reads both roads (AutoCAD DWG) and libraries (Esri Geodatabase)
- Calculates the shortest road route taking in all libraries
- Creates circles whose diameter is relative to a library's book circulation
- Creates an HTML report and an HTML map of the libraries
- Writes the data to HTML and also to Esri Shapefile

<br>**3) Run FME Workspace**
<br>Let's run this workspace. To do this click on the Green run button on the Workbench toolbar:

![](./Images/Img1.204.Ex1.RunButton.png)

The workspace will now run. As it does so, you will see messages pass by in a log window. You may also see numbers appear on the canvas connections and green annotated icons on each object. We'll get to what these are for later!


<br>**4) Locate and Examine Output**
<br>Once the translation is complete, click on the HTML writer object on the canvas. Choose the option to Open Containing Folder:

![](./Images/Img1.205.Ex1.OpenContainingFolder.png)

In the Explorer dialog that opens you will find both the HTML output and the Shapefile dataset:

![](./Images/Img1.206.Ex1.OutputFiles.png)

Open a web browser such as Firefox or Chrome. Open the output file created by FME (usually Ctrl+O or File &gt; Open is the easiest way). You will see a table of libraries, a graph of library statistics, and an interactive map showing where the libraries are located. All this has been generated by FME from the incoming Geodatabase points and attributes:

![](./Images/Img1.207.Ex1.HTMLOutput.png)

This small demonstration illustrates the power of FME. This workspace read data from multiple spatial datasets and wrote it out to datasets in both spatial and "tabular" formats. In between it carried out a series of transformations and spatial analyses, buffering and reprojecting the data, and creating added value and information.

{% call template.congrats() %}

<ul>
  <li>Open an FME workspace</li>
  <li>Run an FME workspace</li>
  <li>Locate the output from an FME workspace</li>
</ul>

{% endcall %}
