### Canvas ###

The FME Workbench canvas is where to define a translation. It is the primary window within Workbench:

By default the workspace reads from left to right; data source on the left, transformation tools in the center, and data destination on the right. Connections between each item represent the flow of data and may branch in different directions, merge together, or both.

### Menu/Toolbar ###

The menu bar and toolbar contain a number of tools: for example, tools for navigating around the Workbench canvas, controlling administrative tasks, and adding or removing readers/writers:
