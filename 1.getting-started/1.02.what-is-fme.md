# What is FME?

**FME (the Feature Manipulation Engine)** is a data translation and transformation tool for solving problems of data interoperability, without the need for coding.

## Extract, Transform, and Load

<!-- Re-write this with updated marketing language -->

FME is sometimes classed as an **ETL** application. ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load. It is a data warehousing tool that extracts data from multiple sources (here A and B), transforms it to fit the usersâ€™ needs and loads it into a destination (C):

While most ETL tools process only tabular data, FME also has the processing capabilities required to handle spatial data, hence the term **Spatial ETL**.

## How FME Works

At the heart of FME is an engine that supports an array of spatial and tabular data types and formats; GIS, CAD, BIM, Point Cloud, XML, Raster, databases, [and many more](https://www.safe.com/integrate/#!).

The capability to support so many data types is made possible by a rich data model that handles all possible geometry and attribute types.

Most importantly, the data translation process is seamless to the user; FME automatically converts between data types as required, and automatically substitutes one attribute or geometry type for another where the destination format does not support it.
