## Report Question

Write a 500 word report on the data integration solution you created.
- Include the brainstorming diagram or outline you created before carrying out the walkthrough analysis. How close were you? What did you not anticipate?
- Which additional dataset did you use?
- What problem or question does your solution address?
- What analysis steps did you carry out?
- Provide a deliverable of some kind to show the value of your project. This could be a map (screenshot of Data Inspector is ok), a table, or a description of a new organizational process made possible by the solution.
