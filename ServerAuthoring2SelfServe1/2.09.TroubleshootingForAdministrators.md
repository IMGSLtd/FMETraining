# Troubleshooting for Administrators

This section shows a few basic troubleshooting techniques in case of emergency

**Data Download: No Output**

If no zip file is output at the end of a Data Download process then the following suggestions may be of help.

- Run the workspace on FME Desktop to confirm that it does actually write some data. If there is no output data then no zip file will be delivered.
- Check that the FME Server has access to the source data. If the source data is not available to FME Server then there will be no output.
- On FME Server check the log file using Jobs > Completed to confirm that the process did actually try to write some data. If not an error message may help to indicate why.

**Data Download: Empty Output**

If an empty zip file is output at the end of a Data Download process then the following may be of help.

- Ensure that when you publish the workspace to FME Server you check the Data Download parameters and choose an output dataset to be associated with the Service. If you donâ€™t, then FME has no way to determine which Writer will provide the output.
