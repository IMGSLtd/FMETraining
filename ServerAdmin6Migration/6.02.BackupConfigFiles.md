# Backup Configuration Files #

Before proceeding with the primary task of backing up your FME Server configuration, we recommend manually backing up the FME Server Configuration Files to a location outside of your FME Server installation directory, in case you need to refer to them later. These files contain configurations for the FME Server Database, Job Routing, and miscellaneous settings for the Transformation and Repository Managers. These configurations are not included in the primary backup procedure. To restore any changes that were made in these files, you must be able to refer to them when the upgrade is complete, so that you can make the corresponding changes in the replacement file.

If you backup FME Server, do not just replace the restored FME Server configuration files with the backup configuration files. The structure of the configuration files may change between releases, so you should go through the old configuration file and the new configuration file together and replace the old configurations as you come across them.
