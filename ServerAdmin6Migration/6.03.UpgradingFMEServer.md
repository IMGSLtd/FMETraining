# Upgrading FME Server #

### Full FME Server Upgrade ###

There are multiple approaches to upgrading your FME Server installation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The following table outlines several factors for upgrading to a second machine with a different hostname, upgrading to a second machine and using the same hostname, and upgrading FME Server in-place, on the same machine.

### FME Engine Only Upgrade ###

FME Engines are the component of FME Server that perform the actual data translations and transformations. At times, you might want to upgrade only your FME Engines and not any other FME Server components. For example, you might want to provide support for recently added formats or other newer functionality included in a new release, which requires only an upgrade of the FME Engines.

Safe supports installing newer FME Engines, as long as the engines share the same major version/year as the current installation of FME Server. For example, on FME Server 2016.0, the FME Engines may be upgraded to 2016.1.3 but may **not** be upgraded to 2017.0

For 2018.0 there is no support for an Engine only upgrade to 2018.1 due to technical changes that have been made to the product.
