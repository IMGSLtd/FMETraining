# Exercise: Creating a New User and Limiting Their Actions #

Your company has recently hired a new analyst who will be accessing FME Server. The new employee doesn't quite fit into the current FME Server user roles you have in place so you need to create a new user role for them.

1. Click on the *Security* page to see a list of your current users.

4. In the *Permissions* section you can decide whether the new user will be able to Access, Create or Manage one or more FME services. You also have the option to copy permissions from a role by selecting the **Load Template** button.

In the following image, the *NewUser* user has been given Access to Run Workspace, Access and Manage to Jobs, and Access and Create to Repositories.

7. Log out of your admin account and sign in with your *NewUser* account. Your homepage should only have limited options on the side bar which reflect the *NewUser* permissions.
