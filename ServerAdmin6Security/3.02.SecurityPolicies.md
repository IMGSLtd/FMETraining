# Role Policies #

There are various sections of security policies that can be set for each role.

### General ###

These are general policies such as the ability to manage jobs, services, and security. For example, if you don’t have the ability to manage security, that item will be missing from the main menu of the user interface.

### Topics ###

Topics are related to Notifications, which we’ll cover later. Different capabilities – read, write, publish, remove – can be assigned for each topic you create.

### Resources ###

Resources are files and datasets stored on FME Server. Different permissions – read, write, upload, delete – can be assigned to each resource.

### Services ###

Services are key items of functionality on FME Server. They are the different methods by which a workspace can be run and output data delivered. Each role can be allowed – or not – to use a particular service.

### Repositories ###

As you know, repositories are a place to store and categorize workspaces. Each role can be given different permissions for each and every repository.

### Connections ###

Connections are predefined logins to either web services or databases. Each role can be given permission to access different connections stored in FME Server.

### Applications ###

Applications are the different ways in which FME Server can be accessed. For example, it’s possible to control access to the FME Server Web Interface for a specific role.
