# Configuring Active Directory/LDAP #

Select *Security* > *Active Directory*

On the *Active Directory* page, you can incorporate your organizationâ€™s Active Directory users and groups into your FME Server security configuration.

When you import user accounts from Active Directory, they can authenticate as **Users** with FME Server using their Active Directory credentials. Optionally, single-sign authentication can be enabled, in conjunction with SASL.

When you import groups from Active Directory, they become **Roles** in FME Server.

To create a new connection, click *Add*.

To remove one or more connections, check the correspond box(es) and click *Remove*.

To add users or roles from a connection, check the box beside the connection and click *Browse Users* or *Browse Groups*, respectively.

To synchronize a connection, check the box beside the connection and click *Synchronize*. This action synchronizes the relationship between users and groups in FME Server with the latest updates to your Active Directory. For example, consider *user1* who belongs to *group1* in FME Server because of a corresponding relationship in Active Directory. If that relationship is subsequently broken in Active Directory, the relationship between *user1* and *group1* will break in FME Server after you synchronize.
