# Role- and User-Based Access #

FME Server security is based on two primary concepts:

- **Users**: Users are the individual accounts that access FME Server. When FME Server is installed for the first time, default user accounts are created.
- **Roles**: Roles are comprised of one or more users.

FME Server security controls access to resources either through role-based or user-based access.

## Role-Based Access ##

Roles make it easy to assign the same set of permissions to multiple users based on job function. Permissions to perform certain operations are assigned to specific roles. In turn, these permissions apply to the users who belong to that role.

For example, a request by user *user1* could be to run a workspace in the Samples repository for the Data Download Service. FME Server security grants access if any of the roles to which *user1* is assigned has permission to run workspaces in the Samples repository, and also has access to the Data Download Service.

A default set of roles is defined when FME Server is installed. These are:

- **fmesuperuser**: For users with unlimited access to the system.
- **fmeadmin**: For users who need to carry out specific administration tasks.
- **fmeauthor**: For users who are authoring workspaces to run on FME Server.
- **fmeuser**: For users who need to run (but not author) workspaces.
- **fmeguest**: For temporary users who need a minimal set of permissions.

A number of default accounts are created too. These are:

- **admin**: Assigned to the fmesuperuser and fmeadmin roles.
- **author**: Assigned to the fmeauthor role.
- **user**: Assigned to the fmeuser role.
- **guest**: Assigned to the fmeguest role.

On the *Roles* page of the Web User Interface, an administrator can:

- Create and remove roles.
- Configure users in roles.
- Configure permissions of roles.

## User-Based Access ##

Another way for FME Server to determine if a user can access a resource is whether the user owns it, or has been given permissions on it.

### User Ownership ###

Anything a user creates in FME Server, such as a repository, is owned by that user. When you own something, you have full permissions on it. This permission supersedes the permissions you have on other items in FME Server based on the role to which you belong.

Additionally, as an owner, you can:

- Share permissions on the items you own with other users or roles.
- Assign ownership of something to another user.

### User Permission ###

Users can be granted permissions on resources, and these permissions may supercede the permissions available to them through their role. (In fact, it is not even necessary for a user to belong to a role.)

On the *Users* page of the Web User Interface, an administrator can:

- Create and remove users.
- Configure users into roles.
- Configure permissions of users.
