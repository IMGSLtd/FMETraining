There are five default reports that exist in FME Server:

Each of these reports are simple HTML files. Clicking on a link opens that file in which a graph displaying the report information is stored:

In the above image, for example, the report shows how many jobs have been run on FME Server per day.

These reports are generated using - what else - FME workspaces. These workspaces use the HTMLReportGenerator transformer and HTML format writer to create the graphs shown in reports. 
<br><br>These are fairly simple workspaces and it is entirely possible to create your own reports - preferably by using an existing report as a template workspace. The Dashboards documentation explains how, but - in brief - any HTML document that is written to the folder resources\dashboards\dashboards will appear as a report in the Dashboards panel of the server web interface.

### Generating and Using Reports ###

The reports in the dashboard panel are not generated and/or updated by default. To have them appear - and be updated - you must carry out the following steps:

1. Browse to Manage &gt; Workspaces and choose the Dashboards repository
2. Run the workspace JobHistoryStatisticsGathering.fmw to generate updated statistics
3. Return to Manage &gt; Workspaces and choose the Dashboards repository
4. Run the workspace for the report you wish to add/update; for example DailyTotalJobs.fmw
5. Browse to Manage &gt; Administration &gt; Dashboards
6. Click on the chosen report to see the latest statistics 

The workspace JobHistoryStatisticsGathering.fmw is also set up to run on a schedule. The schedule is called DashboardStatisticsGathering, runs every 24 hours, and is set to Disabled by default. Therefore to get daily statistics - automatically - requires this schedule to be first enabled.

After FME Server Scheduling has been covered by this course, you'll find it very easy to change the statistics-gathering schedule (say to hourly updates) and add schedules to re-run the dashboard-generating workspaces too. Just be sure to schedule the dashboard workspaces to occur slightly *after* the statistics-gathering workspace, so they are generating reports based on the latest information.
