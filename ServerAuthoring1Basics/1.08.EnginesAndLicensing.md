## Engines and Licensing ##

The first step in getting started on FME Server is to choose the menu option for Engines and Licensing:

This opens the Engine Management page, where you can ensure FME Server is running correctly, is licensed, and has active engines:

### Licensing ###

The upper section of this page relates to licensing. The labels show how many engines are licensing, when the license expires, and what the machine key and serial number are. Buttons allow you to refresh the license, request a new one, or upload a license file.

### Engines ###

The middle part shows the engines that are currently started, their FME build, operating system, and what job they are processing (if any). The platform is important because a distributed FME Server setup can have engines running on a variety of operating systems at the same time.

### Hosts ###

The lower part of the page shows which engines are running on which host, and allows you to easily change the number of engines running, up to the maximum provided for by the current license:

If your FME Server is licensed, and has engines running that are assigned to the correct host, then you are ready to run a published workspace.
