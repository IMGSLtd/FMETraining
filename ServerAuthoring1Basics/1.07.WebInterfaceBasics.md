# Introduction to the FME Server Web Interface

Although translations are authored in FME Workbench, the core tools of FME Server are accessed through a web-based interface. 

The web interface is accessed through the URL **&lt;servername&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/fmeserver** (the port may be optional) or through the start menu:

The web interface for FME Server looks like this:

The main part of the interface displays a page of content that contains information, reports, parameters, and other components. The landing page, for example, has shortcuts to lists of recent jobs, recent projects, and favourite workspace.

The left hand side of the interface contains a set of menus. Selecting a menu item changes the content of the page to match the menu item chosen.

The web interface was thoroughly redesigned for 2017, the biggest change perhaps being the menu moving from the top of the display to the left hand side.

## Web Interface Menu ##

In general, FME Server functionality is accessed through the web interface menu. There are three sections of the menu:

The first section of the menu relates to the **use** of FME Server. It has - among others - options for running a workspace, accessing repositories, setting up schedules, and reviewing job history.

The next section of the menu relates to the **administration** of FME Server. It has - among others - options for managing engines, setting up security, and creating system backups.

The final section of the menu provides help tools; for authors, users, administrators, and developers.

## Getting Started ##

Getting started with the FME Server web interface requires familiarity with three key pages:

- Engines and Licensing
- Run Workspace
- Jobs
