# Introduction to the FME Server Web Interface

Although translations are authored in FME Workbench, the core tools of FME Server are accessed through a web-based interface.

The web interface is accessed through the URL **&lt;servername&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/fmeserver** (the port may be optional) or through the start menu:

The web interface for FME Server looks like this:

The main part of the interface displays a page of content that contains information, reports, parameters, and other components. The landing page, for example, has shortcuts to lists of recent jobs, recent projects, and favorite workspaces.

The left-hand side of the interface contains a set of menus. Selecting a menu item changes the content of the page to match the menu item chosen.

## Web Interface Menu ##

In general, FME Server functionality is accessed through the web interface menu. There are two main sections in this menu:

The first section relates to the **use** of FME Server. It has - among others - options for running a workspace, accessing repositories, setting up schedules, and reviewing job history.

The next section of the menu relates to the **administration** of FME Server. It has - among others - options for managing engines, setting up security, and creating system backups.

Notice the Workspace Viewer in the menu pictured above? That's a brand new feature in FME Server 2018 that allows you to get a read-only view of any workspaces published to FME Server. It lets you see all the readers, writers, transformers, and parameters set within the workspace:
