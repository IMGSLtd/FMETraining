    <question multiple>
        <p>I have a Server with two engines. Four users submit jobs at the same time. What happens?</p>
        <answer>Two jobs are processed. Two jobs are returned to their authors.</answer>
        <answer>Two extra engines will fire up automatically to process all four jobs.</answer>
        <answer>The four jobs will be processed simultaneously, sharing the two engines.</answer>
        <answer correct>Two jobs are processed. The other two sit in a queue until an engine becomes free.</answer>
        <explanation>Yes, the server core keeps a queue of jobs and submits them as engines become available. Extra engines will not fire up, even if you do have spare licenses, and jobs will never be ignored just because no engine is currently available.</explanation>

    <question multiple>
        <p>If I wanted to find out about workspaces stored in a repository - for example I'm building a tool to catalogue my workspaces - what is the best way to do it?</p>
        <answer correct>Use the FME Server REST API</answer>
        <answer>Scrape the contents of the Server repository page</answer>
        <answer>Get a file listing from the repository folder</answer>
        <answer>Connect to the FME Server database to query it directly</answer>
        <explanation>The REST API is a quick, simple, and official method to query the workspace repositories. Querying the database directly is permissible, however, under no circumstances should you write into or update directly the contents of the database.</explanation>

    <question multiple>
        <p>Which of these are good reasons for running engines on multiple operating systems at the same time? Pick all that apply.</p>
        <answer correct>A required format is only available on 32-bit or 64-bit, not both.</answer>
        <answer correct>A required format is only available on Windows, or Linux, not both.</answer>
        <answer>FME Desktop users author workspaces using a mix of Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms.</answer>
        <answer correct>You want to process heavy-scale jobs on a more powerful platform.</answer>
        <explanation>Basically some formats are only available on certain platforms and so you may need to mix of operating systems to cover all your requirements. You may also want to redirect large-scale jobs to a more powerful platform. However, it doesn't matter what platform the workspace author used; their jobs will run on whatever system FME Server is based on.</explanation>
