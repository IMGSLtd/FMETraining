## Platforms  ##
[comment]: <> (don't like this wording...)

FME Server can be deployed in a variety of ways:

- **Local Infrastructure (Physical Hardware)** - This is the traditional configuration where you purchase FME Server and install it on your own hardware systems.

- **Infrastructure as a Service (Virtual Hardware)** - This is where you purchase FME Server and install it on virtual hardware that is provided as a service by a company such as Amazon.

- **Platform as a Service (FME Cloud)** - This is where FME Server is delivered pre-installed on an Amazon virtual computer, with the whole platform provided by Safe Software on a pay-as-you-go basis.

NEW SECTION HERE TO MENTION THAT DOCKER IS NOW OUT OF TECH PREVIEW AND FULLY SUPPORTED FOR FME SERVER 2018.

## Distributed Systems ##

[comment]: <> (THIS HAS CHANGED IN 2018. I DONT KNOW THE DETAILS ON THE DIFFERENCES YET. WILL NEED TO UPDATE THE DIAGRAM AND INFORMATION PROVIDED ABOUT THIS.)

A distributed system is one in which the different components of a system are located on separate, networked, computers.

For example, in a distributed environment FME Engines can run on a computer or several computers that are separate from the FME Server host. Administrators can configure the FME Engines to register with a failover FME Server host, which acts as a backup if the primary FME Server host fails.

FME Server licensing does not use a separate license server. Instead licensing is stored in the FME Server System Share, which multiple FME Server Cores can point towards.
