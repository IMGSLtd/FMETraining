## Platforms  ##

FME Server can be deployed in a variety of ways:

- **Local Infrastructure (Physical Hardware)** - This is the traditional configuration where you purchase FME Server and install it on your own hardware systems.

- **Infrastructure as a Service (Virtual Hardware)** - This is where you purchase FME Server and install it on virtual hardware that is provided as a service by a company such as Amazon.

- **Platform as a Service (FME Cloud)** - This is where FME Server is delivered pre-installed on an Amazon virtual computer, with the whole platform provided by Safe Software on a pay-as-you-go basis.

## Distributed Systems ##

A distributed system is one in which the different components of a system are located on separate, networked, computers.

For example, in a distributed environment FME Engines can run on a computer or several computers that are separate from the FME Server host. The FME Server Database and Web Application Server can also be installed separately.
