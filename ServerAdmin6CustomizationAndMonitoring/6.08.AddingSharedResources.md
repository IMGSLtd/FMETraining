# Adding Shared Resources #

The Resources page is a convenient way to store and access the following:

- FME Server backup files.
- HTML reports generated for Dashboards.
- Data files that can be shared between different workspaces, regardless of the repository.
- FME Engine Resources, including custom formats, custom transformers, custom coordinate systems, and custom Java and Python modules.
- FME Server and database log files.
- Connections to your own network resources and Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets.
- Temporary files created by FME Server.

## Uploading Files and Folders ##

1. To overwrite existing files with the same names as those being uploaded, select *Overwrite Existing Files*.
2. Select *Upload* and specify whether to upload an entire folder or specific files. Alternatively, drag and drop a file or folder on to the page.

## Creating New Network Resources ##

As of FME Server 2018.0 you can create new network shares in the FME Server Web Interface. Ensure that the FME Server Web Application, FME Server Core, and FME Server Engine **services** are running as a domain service account with the correct network access permissions as required **(Read|Write)**

## Sharing Resources ##

To share a resource, click the *Share with Others* icon. Through sharing, you can grant levels of permissions on an item to other users. You can share an item if you own it, or if you are a user with Manage Security permissions, such as an administrator.
