# System Email #

FME Server can send reset password messages, and also publishes messages about significant events, including repository activity, as well as logged warnings and errors. One of the ways in which these messages are published is via email.

System Email in configured under the menu item System Configuration &gt; General &gt; System Email.

In FME Server 2019.0, System Event and Reset Password messages had separately configured email accounts.

In FME Server 2019.1, FME Server System Email is used to send outgoing emails for both Reset Password and System Event messages.
