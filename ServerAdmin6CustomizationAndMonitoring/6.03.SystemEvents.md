This page shows the type, contents and datetime for all occurrences of enabled System Events.



### Email Notifications ###

When you select a System Event from the configuration page, you have the option to enable Send Email Notifications. This will send an email every time the System Event occurs.

Enabling email notifications allows you to configure:

- Who will receive the notification
- The email subject
- The email format (Text/HTML)
- The email body

Composing the email body is easier in FME Server 2019+ with the new Text Editor. This allows administrators to add in details about the system event such as:

- The event ID
- The event time
- The event type

Depending on what the System Event is, you may see different event details available in the text editor.

System Events are also available to administrators as a Trigger in Automations:
