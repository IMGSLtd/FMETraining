# Using R with FME Server #

To initiate R scripts from FME Server, such as through the **RCaller** transformer in an FME Desktop workspace, you must perform the following on all machines that run FME Engines:
	
1. Install R.
2. Install the sqldf package for R.

Alternatively, you can direct FME Server to an R interpreter that is installed in a non-standard location. For more information on using R in FME, see the [RCaller documentation](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/rcaller.htm?Highlight=rcaller)
