# Using R with FME Server #

To execute R scripts from FME Server, such as through the **RCaller** transformer in a FME Desktop workspace, you must perform the following on all machines that run FME Engines:
	
1. Install R.
2. Install the sqldf package for R.



Alternatively, you can direct FME Server to an R interpreter that is installed in a non-standard location.
