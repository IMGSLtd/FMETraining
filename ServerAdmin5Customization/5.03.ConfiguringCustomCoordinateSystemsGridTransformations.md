# Configuring Custom Coordinate Systems/Grid Transformations #

Workspaces that are run from FME Server can use custom formats, custom transformers, and custom coordinate systems in the same way that FME Workbench does. There are three ways to upload these shared custom resources to FME Server:

- **Use the *Resources* page of the FME Server web interface**: this method makes custom formats, custom transformers, and custom coordinate systems available to all workspaces on FME Server.
- **Publish to FME Server**: makes a custom format or custom transformer available to all workspaces in the same repository to which it is published.
- **Publish to FME Server with a Workspace**: this method allows you to add resources when publishing a workspace. You can upload the resources to a repository or a shared resource folder. If you upload to a shared resource folder, the resources are available to all other workspaces on FME Server. If you choose a repository, the resources are available to all other workspaces in the same repository to which the current workspace is published.

If custom coordinate system files are uploaded to any of the applicable *Engine* subfolders, the FME Server Engines service must be restarted before they can be used in a workspace. These include the *CoordinateSystemsExceptions*, *CoordinateSystemGridOverrides*, *CoordinateSystems*, and *CsmapTransformationExceptions* subfolders.
