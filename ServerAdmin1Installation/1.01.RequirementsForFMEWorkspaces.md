# Requirements for FME Workspaces #

To perform data transformations, FME Server runs workspaces. When a workspace runs on FME Server, it is referred to as a job.

FME Workbench is used to author and publish the workspaces used by FME Server. FME Workbench is not part of FME Server; rather, it is a part of the FME Desktop product. If you do not have access to FME Desktop, you cannot publish workspaces to FME Server, although you can still perform and test the installation. 

The version of FME Workbench you use must match the FME Server version you have installed. This requirement ensures that the workspaces you author will run when published to FME Server. If you are running a FME Server version that is older that your FME Workbench, it is possible to upgrade the FME Engines used by FME Server to match your FME Workbench version.

Web connection allows FME Workbench to connect to FME Server using the HTTP protocol. It requires the Web Application Server port to be open to communication between the FME Workbench computer and the FME Server computer.

### GridShift Files ###

If you plan to run workspaces that transform data between datums NAD27 and NAD83, you can use datum shift files for Canada or the US.

### Third-Party Applications for FME ###

FME Workspaces often rely on third party applications for connecting to data sources. Examples include an Oracle client for connecting to an Oracle database and an ArcGIS installation for connecting to Esri Geodatabases. If you must install a third-party application for your FME Desktop installation, repeat that installation on your FME Server computer.
