# 32- and 64-bit Engines on Same Machine #

In some cases, you may want to install 32- and 64-bit Engines on the same machine. For example, you may currently be running only 64-bit engines, but you want to run a workspace from FME Server containing a format that runs only on a 32-bit engine.

WARNING: This procedure removes the ability to configure FME Engines on the Engines & Licensing page of the Web User Interface. Run the same bit version of FME Engines unless absolutely necessary.

Note: A 64-bit engine will not run on a 32-bit version of Windows.

Use Job Routing to configure specific jobs to run on the new engine.
