# Exercise - Using Python with FME Server #


1) First we will need a python job to upload to FME Server. Open FME Workbench and start a new blank workspace.

2) Add a **Creator** transformer and a **PythonCaller** transformer and attach the **Creator** to the **PythonCaller**. Next right click the **PythonCaller** and select **connect logger**.

### Changing the Python Interpreter ###

For workspaces built with FME Desktop 2016 or later, the Python interpreter you want the FME Engines to use must be specified in the workspace, according to the Python Compatibility workspace parameter.
