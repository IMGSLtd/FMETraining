# Course Overview #

This training material covers how to install and administer FME Server.

The training will introduce the techniques and information required to efficiently manage FME Server and to troubleshoot any problems that might arise.

## Prerequisites ##

This training material is intended for persons with no prior experience of using FME. However, it does assume a basic familiarity with the concepts and practices of system administration, system architectures, and web technologies.


## Course Structure ##

The full course is made up of seven sections. These sections are:

- Planning an FME Server Installation
- FME Server Connectivity
- Scalability and Performance
- FME Server Customization/Enterprise
- Migration and Upgrades
- FME Server Security
- Troubleshooting

The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the course content in a different order and will skip or add new content to better customize the course to your needs.

Therefore the length and content of the course may vary, particularly when delivered online.


## About the Manual ##
The FME Server administration training manual not only forms the basis for FME Server training – in-person or online – but is also useful reference material for future work you may undertake with FME.

This training material is designed specifically for use with FME2017. You may not have some of the functionality described if you use an older version of FME.
