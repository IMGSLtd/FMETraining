# Security Policies #

Security policies can be applied to each item, role or user. While permissions can be set on each individual item in FME Server, the access to features and functionality in the FME Server web interface are managed by the *Access* or *Manage* privileges.

### Run Workspace ###

Run Workspace controls the ability to - you guessed it - run a workspace on FME Server. The *Advanced* option allows a user to access advanced job directives and the direct URL to run a workspace.

### Jobs ###

Access to the Jobs page allows the user to view the jobs *they* have run, or cancel any of their jobs that are currently running or in the queue. The *Manage* option allows them to view the *full job history* (all users) on FME Server and the ability to cancel any job, or remove any job from the history.

### Automations ###

Automations is a new feature in FME Server 2019.0. Create permissions for Automations allows the user to create automated workflows that respond to schedules or triggers, in a range of supported protocols. A user granted Create permission also requires Create permissions for: Publications, Subscriptions, Schedules and Topics, and Access permissions for Repositories.

### Schedules ###

Schedules are one of the core functions FME Server provides. Access to each schedule can be controlled.

### Repositories ###

Repositories are a place to store and categorize workspaces. Each role or user can be given different permissions for every repository - download, read, publish, run, remove. Access permission is not necessary to run a workspace - only run permission on the applicable repository is required.

### Version Control ###

Version Control is implemented in FME Server 2018.0 or greater. It allows users to version the workspaces they have published to FME Server, either during publishing or by using the FME Server web interface. A user can be granted Access or Manage permissions.

### Connections ###

Connections are predefined logins to either web services or databases. Each role or user can be given permission to manage the different connections stored in FME Server. With this permission, the user can create new definitions, and manage connections in the FME Server web interface.

### Projects ###

Projects are created to manage a set of FME Server resources, for example workspaces, schedules, publications, and subscriptions. Different permissions - Can View, Can Edit, Full Access - can be assigned to a user or role for each project.

### Engines & Licensing ###

The Engines & Licensing page concerns licensing FME Server, managing the number of active FME Server Engines, and the number of connected hosts.

Granting the permission for Security allows the role or user to create, enable, disable, and remove users and roles, as well as configuring for Active Directory.

### System Cleanup ###

System Cleanup tasks are defined in the FME Server web interface and help to manage temporary files and log files among other items.
