# Workspaces as Actions #

In Automations the Run Workspace is labelled an action, since it reacts to an incoming message and therefore must be set up by being connected to a Trigger.

When that Trigger receives an incoming message, any workspace connected to that through an *FME Workspace* protocol is run.


Within an Automation the Action protocol is called (as you might have guessed) *Run Workspace* and falls under the Internal Action Category (orange node).

When that protocol is chosen for a new Action, and the Repository and workspace specified, the selected workspace is examined and a list of its published parameters provided:

Having the parameters in a dialog like this means it is simple and easy to set up a workspace to run however you want it to in response to a trigger. Once created, whenever that Trigger receives a message from the sending client, the workspace will run in response.
