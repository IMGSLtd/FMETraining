## Protocols ##

A protocol is a system of data exchange between FME Server and a client.

We know that FME sends and receives messages. Protocols are the method by which these messages are sent and received. Each Trigger and Action is defined using a particular communication protocol.

To trigger an incoming message by email – for example – you would create an Automation using an Email Trigger. To send a notification to a Java Message Service, you would create an Automation that contains a JMS message Action.

There are many different protocols available in FME Server; some of them are only for use as a Trigger, others are only available as Actions, and some of them can be used with both types.

This table lists the different Trigger and Action protocols and the following pages go into greater detail on some of the most commonly used types.

Protocols are pre-defined components in the FME Server architecture and do not need to be defined in the web interface.

However, a number of fields are made available to configure when an Automation is created.

For example, here are the parameters for a Directory modified Trigger:

These parameters must be set when the Automation is created as they are needed in order for FME to be able to watch and receive notifications about this Directory. Without configuring these parameters the Automation will have no behave as anticipated when enabled.
