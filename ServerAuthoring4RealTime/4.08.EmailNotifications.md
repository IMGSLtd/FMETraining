# An Introduction to Email Notifications

It’s important to cover email notifications in some detail because they are one of the most commonly used type of notifications on FME Server.

“Email” is a protocol that may be used by both Publication and Subscription components. Email Publications receive incoming email from Publishers and Email Subscriptions send outgoing email to Subscribers.


## Email Protocols ##

In actual fact, email is not a single protocol. There are several protocols (methods of email transfer) that exist. FME Server supports two of these email-related protocols: **SMTP** and **IMAP**.

The SMTP protocol is the ability to *directly* send or receive an email through an email server built into FME Server.

The IMAP protocol is an *indirect* process that connects to an email account on a server elsewhere. When that account receives an email the IMAP protocol passes it on to FME Server.
