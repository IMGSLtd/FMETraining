# An Introduction to Email Notifications

It’s important to cover email notifications in some detail because they are one of the most commonly used type of notifications on FME Server.

“Email” is a protocol that may be used by both Publication and Subscription components. Email Publications receive incoming email from external clients and Email Subscriptions send outgoing email.


## Email Protocols ##

In actual fact, email is not a single protocol. There are several protocols (methods of email transfer) that exist. FME Server supports two of these email-related protocols: **SMTP** and **IMAP**.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the ability to *directly* receive an email through an email server built into FME Server, or *indirecty* send an email though a SMTP service, for example a Gmail account.

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an *indirect* process that connects to an email account on a server elsewhere. When that account receives an email the IMAP protocol passes it on to FME Server.
