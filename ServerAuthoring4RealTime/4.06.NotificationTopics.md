## Topics ##

A Topic is a component that acts as a mediator for messages and defines the message content. Think of it as a subject line for notifications.

Like Publications, a Topic is created in the FME Server Web User Interface, under the Notifications section.

All Publications are linked to one (or more) Topics, so that when an incoming message is received it is categorized and the related Topic is triggered.

Because a Publication can be linked to multiple Topics, each incoming message can trigger multiple actions to occur. Additionally, multiple Publications can trigger the same topic.

For example, a lightning strike sensor might publish to the topics WeatherEvent and AircraftAlerts, whereas a flood sensor might publish to the topics WeatherEvent and RoadConditions.




As with Publications, each Subscription is also tied to one (or more) Topics, and each Topic can be subscribed to by multiple Subscriptions.

For example, a police headquarters might subscribe to the RoadConditions topic, to receive notifications on that subject. The local TV weather channel also subscribes to the RoadConditions topics, but in addition subscribes to WeatherEvent to hear about those particular events.

For example, a report about a soccer team’s tax return would be filed
under both ‘Financial’ and ‘Sports’ because it relates to both.”
