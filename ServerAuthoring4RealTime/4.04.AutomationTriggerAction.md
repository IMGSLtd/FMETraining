## Triggers ##

A Trigger is an FME Server component that receives incoming notifications from a client.

To set up a trigger in FME Server, a workspace author (or administrator) must build a new Automation. An Automation is created in the FME Server Web Interface on the Automations > Build page:

## Action ##

An Action is an FME Server component that sends outgoing notifications to a client.

To send a notification in FME Server, a workspace author (or administrator) must first create an Automation that contains a trigger, the outport of this node is then connected to the action - just like when you connect transformers in FME Workbench.

Similar to FME Workbench, Automations are constructed in a user friendly drag and drop interface. Triggers and Actions are displayed on the canvas as nodes identifiable by their different color. Input and output ports are used to create connections to pass the messages through and a series of configurable parameters are available depending on the protocol.
