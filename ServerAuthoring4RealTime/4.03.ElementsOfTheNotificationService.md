## Elements of the Notification Service ##

The Notification Service includes a number of different components.

- Clients An external user or system that sends or receives a notification
- Publications An event handler that listens for incoming notifications
- Subscriptions An event handler that dispatches outgoing notifications
- Topics A subject that describes what the notification is about
- Protocols Methods by which FME Server can receive or send notifications

Although this diagram shows a continuous process, from a sending client through FME Server to a receiving client, it is not necessary for all of these components to be used in a setup.

If the system is designed for FME Server to only receive notifications, then only the publications side of the diagram is relevant. Likewise, if the system is intended for FME Server to only send notifications, then only the subscriptions side of the diagram applies.
