## Workspaces as an Action AND a Trigger ##

We've now looked at how to set up a workspace to be an Action (reacting to incoming messages) and how to set up a workspace as a Trigger (sending outgoing messages). A workspace can do each task individually, but when it is set as both an Action and a Trigger, the overall setup looks like this:

Unlike most Triggers/Actions in Automations the Run Workspace node has both an incoming and outgoing port meaning it can both receive messages from a Trigger, and continue the Automation by sending messages out to another action upon job completion.

In this scenario, the same workspace that receives an incoming notification also sends an outgoing notification. For example, details of a lightning strike are received via a LightningStrike topic. This trigger starts a workspace that processes the incoming information; for example, it determines which state/province/county the strike occurred in. The workspace then creates a new message and dispatches it to a WeatherAlert Action.
