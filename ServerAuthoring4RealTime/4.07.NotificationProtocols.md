## Protocols ##

A protocol is a system of data exchange between FME Server and a client. 

We already know that FME sends and receives notifications. Protocols are the method by which these notifications are sent and received. Each Publication and Subscription is defined using a particular communication protocol. 

To trigger a Publication by email – for example – you would use the Email protocol. To send a notification to subscribers with an Apple mobile device, you would use the Apple Push protocol.

There are many different protocols available in FME Server; some of them are only for use on Publications, some are only for Subscriptions, and some of them can be used with both notification types.

This table lists the different Publication and Subscription protocols and the following pages go into detail on some of the most important.

Protocols are pre-defined components in the FME Server architecture and do not need to be defined in the Web User Interface.

However, a number of fields are made available to configure them when a Publication or Subscription chooses to make use of that protocol.

For example, here are the parameters for an Amazon SQS Subscription:

These parameters must be set when the Subscription is created as they are needed in order to be able to send out a notification using the protocol.
