# Workspaces as a Publisher #

When a workspace needs to send an outgoing notification it is done by having the workspace trigger a particular topic. In other words it is a publisher sending information as a notification. 

When that topic is triggered any Subscription connected to that topic receives the notification, plus any message that the workspace is passing on.

Publishing notification messages from a workspace is useful for both sending messages containing content from the data being processed, and for reporting the status of a translation, such as whether it has run successfully or ended in a failure.

Workspaces can be set up to trigger topics in one of two ways: 

- Registering with the topic when published
- Using a transformer
