## Workspaces as a Subscription ##

When a workspace needs to react to an incoming notification it is done by connecting the workspace to a particular topic using a specific Subscriber protocol called (as you might have guessed) *workspace*. 

When that topic is triggered (by a Publication or any other means) any workspace connected to that topic through a *workspace* protocol is run.

NEW - THIS IS NEW FOR 2016. DON'T USE THE OLD PUSH VERSION!


**Subscribed Topics** tells FME which notification topics should trigger the workspace.

**Notification Reader** tells FME which Reader should receive the notification content.

In this example any incoming message that is flagged under RoadCondition will cause the workspace to run. The message content will be funneled through a plain text Reader called – appropriately enough – IncomingMessage.
