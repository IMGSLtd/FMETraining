# An Introduction to Email Notifications

It’s important to cover email notifications in some detail because they are the most commonly used type of notification on FME Server.

“Email” is actually a protocol used by Publication and Subscription components. Email Publications receive incoming email from Publishers and Email Subscriptions send outgoing email to Subscribers.

## Email Protocols ##

FME Server can make use of email messages as both an incoming and outgoing notification protocol. There are two email-related protocols available in FME Server: **SMTP** and **IMAP**.

The SMTP protocol is the ability to *directly* send or receive an email through an email server built into FME Server.

The IMAP protocol is an *indirect* process that connects to an email account on a server elsewhere. When that account receives an email the IMAP protocol passes it on to FME Server.
