## Registering a Workspace Publication ##

The first way to have a workspace communicate notifications is to register it with a topic when the workspace is published to FME Server.

Here, for example, the workspace is registered with the Data Download service. When the workspace is run using that service, it will post to the RoadInfo topic on successful completion. 

Notifications are sent once the workspace is complete. The way in which the workspace is run is not important. Notifications can be sent for workspaces run using the Job Submitter Service, or the Data Download Service, or any other service.

Having two Topic parameters is useful because different notifications can be sent depending on whether the workspace succeeds or fails.

A third parameter - Post Data from Writer - defines the content of the message being sent (more on that to come).

Four Topics are pre-installed with FME Server to handle workspace notifications. There are two topics for the Job
Submitter Service (one for success, one for failure) and two for the Data Download Service (again, one for success, one for failure). These topics are triggered automatically by FME Server so a system administrator – for example – could subscribe to these topics to receive notifications from all workspaces.
