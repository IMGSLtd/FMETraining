        <p>All notification setups must have which of these:</p>
        <answer correct>Triggers AND Actions </answer>
        <answer>Triggers OR Actions Or both</answer>
        <answer>Triggers OR Actions, but never both</answer>
        <answer>None of the above</answer>
        <explanation>In FME Server Automations it is necessary for all of the components to be used in a setup. This is because the system is designed to allow FME Server to react to incoming Notifications, if you designed an Automation that only contained an incoming Trigger the Automation could not be started because the incoming message is not being passed forward to anything. Likewise if you only had an Action in the Automation, this can never send a notification if it does not receive an event to kick it off. For this reason all components are required to Start an Automation.</explanation>

    <question multiple>
        <p>I want my workspace to send me an email when it is run, so I know when people are using it to download data. When I publish it, what should I register it to?</p>
        <answer>The Notification Service</answer>
        <answer correct>The Data Download Service</answer>
        <answer>The Email (SMTP) Protocol</answer>
        <answer>The Workspace Subscriber Protocol</answer>
        <explanation>I'm setting it up for people to download data, so I register it as a Data Download service. It's as simple as that. To get a notification I just have to pick a topic to trigger in the Data Download settings. Of course, to get an email I must set up an Email Action connected to that topic - but that has nothing at all to do with how I register the workspace!</explanation>

    <question multiple>
        <p>I've got a workspace that reads 50,000 features, transforms them, and writes them out. If I want to send a single notification that the features have been read, which combination of transformers would be of most use?</p>
        <answer>Creator/FeatureWriter/FMEServerNotifier</answer>
        <answer>Creator/FMEServerJobSubmitter</answer>
        <answer>Creator/FeatureReader/FMEServerNotifier</answer>
        <answer correct>FeatureHolder/Sampler/FMEServerNotifier</answer>
        <explanation>I'm sending a notification (not running a job) so I use the FMEServerNotifier. I already have a reader so I don't need a transformer to read or write data. However I do need a Sampler transformer to reduce the number of features down to one; otherwise I'll send 50,000 notifications. The FeatureHolder ensures the notification is not triggered until all features have been read. It would look like this:

    <question multiple>
        <p>Which of the Receiver transformers has a parameter to stop it running continuously? Select all that apply.</p>
        <answer correct>SQSConnector</answer>
        <answer>WebSocketReceiver</answer>
        <answer>JMSReceiver</answer>
        <answer correct>TCPIPReceiver</answer>
        <explanation>The SQSConnector has the ability to switch to a number of messages to read, and the TCPIPReceiver has the option to close the connection once the publishing client disconnects.</explanation>
