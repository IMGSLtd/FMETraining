## Clients ##

A client is a user or system that sends or receives a message to/from FME Server. The client may be a physical person, or may just be a component in a computer system. Either way, the majority of the time a client is not a core part of FME Server, rather someone or something that interacts with it. There are two trigger protocol exceptions to this (Schedules and System Events) whereby FME Server is also the client sending the message.

For example, a database update might cause a trigger to send a notification to FME Server, in which case the database system is the client. However, a client could also be a person who, for example, triggers a notification by sending an email to FME Server.

Likewise, FME Server can send a notification for another client system to receive. Alternatively, this client can also be a real person, who might receive a notification in the form of an email.
