## Microsoft Formats and Transformers ##
FME 2018 introduces a new set of transformers and formats for Microsoft-related formats. These are:

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Reader</th><th>Writer</th><th>Transformer</th></tr>
<tr><th>Excel</th><td>Existing</td><td>Existing</td><td>New: ExcelStyler</td></tr>
<tr><th>Word</th><td>None</td><td>New</td><td>New: MSWordStyler</td></tr>
<tr><th>PowerPoint</th><td>None</td><td>New</td><td>New: PowerPointStyler</td></tr>
</table>

In short, FME 2018 has new writers for Word and PowerPoint, and new styling transformers for all three formats. An Excel reader and writer has existed in FME for a long time, but the writer has new formatting options that can be fulfilled using the ExcelStyler.
