This exercise demonstrates the Transact call, which is used to run a job synchronously on the FME Server. To find more information on the Transact call visit your FME REST API page and look for the transformations section or visit the [Rest API Transformations](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/index.html#!/transformations) documentation.   

An example of running a job synchronously would be:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}
.tg .tg-ao4k{background-color:#e6ffe6;color:#333333;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-a080{background-color:#e6ffe6;vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-ao4k">POST</th>
    <th class="tg-a080">http://&lt;yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/transformations/transact/Samples/austinDownload.fmw</th>
  </tr>
</table>


Notice the **Transact** statement indicates to the FME Server that you will wait
until the process is complete before receiving a result. In Postman you
will need to set up the headers section and the URL as well. Here is how
you would set up this call in Postman.

While synchronous calls are easier to use in a web application compared to asynchronous calls, the application will be stalled until the call is completed. This is a trade-off that should be considered while developing with the FME Server REST API.

<br>**1) Enter in the URL**

The first step is to add in the URL. Paste the URL below, in the top grey area that says "Enter request URL." Then set the drop-down section from *GET* to *POST*.

    http://<yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/transformations/transact/Samples/austinDownload.fmw

Users on the training computers can change yourServerHost to localhost and other users should change yourServerHost to their servers host name.

The Transact call documentation can be found [here](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/index.html#!/transformations/transact_post_23).

<br>**2) Enter in the Headers**

In this call we have a request body, that will be in JSON. This is
displayed in the Content-Type section. Additionally, we are requesting
JSON back which is under Accept = application/JSON. The Authorization is
where you would enter your token.

    Headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
      Accept: application/json
      Authorization: fmetoken token=<yourTOKEN>

To enter in the headers required for this call. Click on the Headers tag as demonstrated below.  

![](./Images/image4.1.2.TransactPostman.png)




<br>**3) Enter in the Body**

Next, we need to enter the body of the call. *Click on the body section
of the call* and *click on the raw button* and paste in the body provided.

    Body:
    {
      "publishedParameters": [
        {
          "name": "MAXY",
          "value": "42"
        },
        {
          "name": "THEMES",
          "value": [
            "airports",
            "cenart"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

<br>**4) Click Send**

Click Send! Now, wait until the call is returned and you will receive a message like this.

![](./Images/image4.1.4.TransactResponsePostman.png)



<br>**5) View in the FME Server**

Now that the job has been submitted, you can view it in the FME Server. Go to your FME Server and click on the Jobs tab in the left-hand sidebar.

![](./Images/image4.1.5.JobId.png)



You should be able to notice a few things. The job was run by the admin because the token that was used belonged to the admin.

Also, you can note that the priority of the job was 5. This was set in the body of the call.

<br>**6) Find the Job Log and find THEMES**

Click on the Job.

The jobs page provides a more detailed description of the job. Here, we can find the job log. The job log provides information such as, what features were written, how many features are written, and what engine was used to complete the job.

<br> Scroll down to the Jobs Log

The Job Log will always be after the completed section. The completed section gives a quick overview of the job where the log is much more detailed.

<br> Find the THEMES in the Log

Simply, hit ctrl + f, to find THEMES in the log. It should display 'airports cenart'.

We know that the job was completed with the requested parameters.

Let's update the parameters and try the call again.


<br>**7) Find the Published Parameters for the Workspace**

Go to the RunWorkspace Page. Then, select Samples as the Repository and austinDownload.fmw as the workspace. Scroll down the page until you see the advanced section. Click on the plus sign, then find the published parameters. Here, we have all the parameters we can modify in the workspace. Look at the options, this time we will run the call with the railroad and streetcl options.

<br>**8) Open Up Postman and modify the body**

If you kept Postman open simply click on the body tab again. Now change the THEMES values to railroad and streetcl.

<br>**9) Find the job in your FME Server**

Open your FME Server, then click on the left-hand panel of the Server where it says Jobs. Click the latest austinDownload job. Scroll down to find the job log.

Here, you can investigate if the job was successfully completed and what parameters were used. Here, we can see the correct features were written.
