Checking the box to remove the contents of a Project removes all of the project components:
<br><br><span style="color:lightslategrey">1. True</span>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold">2. False</span>
<br><br>A Project can contain users and roles. The remove tool won't remove the user carrying out the removal, nor will it remove any role for which that user is part of. Also it won't remove components you don't have permission to remove.
