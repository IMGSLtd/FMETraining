# Sharing a Project

A project is often carried out by a group of FME users and authors. Therefore it makes sense that a Project can be shared among multiple FME users.

## Share Project ##

Sharing a project is carried out on the Projects page (accessed via the main menu) by simply clicking the Share with Others button for the Project to be shared:

You don't even need to select the Project first.

The Share with Others tool works the same way as the tool for sharing a repository: it opens a pop-up dialog in which to select a user and choose the level of permission that you wish to give to them:

Remember, FME Security is based on users and roles. Roles are analogous to a group of users. When sharing a Project, the "user" field can be an individual user, or it can be applied to a particular role; for example, you can give the ability to view your project to anyone in the *fmeuser* role.

Sharing a Project gives the ability to access not just repositories and workspaces, but all of the components related to that Project.

As of FME Server 2019, FME Server Projects can be shared on the FME Hub.  Check out [this list of projects](https://hub.safe.com/?page=1&page_size=10&types=fme_projects&order=updated_at_desc) that are already available for download to import into your own FME Server.

Want to share your Project with other users in the FME Community? You can also upload projects that you've built to share on the [FME Hub](https://hub.safe.com). There is a set of FME Hub specific parameters that you can fill in when creating a Project to prepare it for publishing to the FME Hub:
