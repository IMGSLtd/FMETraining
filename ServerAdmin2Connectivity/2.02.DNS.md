# DNS #

It is important to know the name of your host computer when using FME Server. During the installation, you will be prompted:

- To enter the hostname for connecting to  FME Server (with Express installation),  
- To specify the host that will run the FME Server Core (with Distributed installation), or 
- To specify the name of the machine hosting the primary FME Server Core (with Engine installation).

It is important to make sure you have the correct hostname for proper control and management of FME Engines.
