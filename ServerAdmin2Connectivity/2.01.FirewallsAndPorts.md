# Firewalls and Ports #

### Configuring Firewall Settings ###

The FME Server Web Services and other clients use the FME Server API to communicate with the FME Server Core over TCP/IP. Requests are sent to the FME Server Core over port 7071. Result messages are returned to clients over a randomly assigned port created by the FME Server Core. Therefore, be sure to configure any firewall settings on the &lt;webHost&gt; with a rule to allow for full communication with the &lt;coreHost&gt; machines.

When specific ports are desired, the port should be made available and not blocked by firewall settings.

Note: An Inbound Rule "Allow All" is created for &lt;FMEServerInstall&gt;\Server\fme\fme.exe on Windows machines when FME Server is installed.
