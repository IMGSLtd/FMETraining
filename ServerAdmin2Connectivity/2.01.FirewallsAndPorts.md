# Firewalls and Ports #

### Configuring Firewall Settings ###

The FME Server Web Services and other clients communicate with the FME Server Core over TCP/IP. Requests are sent to the FME Server Core over port 7071. Result messages are returned to clients over a randomly assigned port created by the FME Server Core. Therefore, be sure to configure any firewall settings on the <webHost\> with a rule to allow for full communication with the <coreHost\> machines.

When specific ports are desired, the port should be made available and not blocked by firewall settings.

### Ports ###
