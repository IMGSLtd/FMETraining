# Community Information and Resources #
Safe Software actively promotes users of FME to become part of the FME Community.

## The FME Community ##
The **[FME Community](https://knowledge.safe.com/ "FME Community")** is a one-stop shop for all community resources, plus tools for browsing documentation and downloads.

### Knowledge Base ###
The FME Knowledge Base contains a wealth of information; including tips, tricks, examples, and FAQs. There are sections on both FME Desktop and FME Server, with articles on topics from installation and licensing to the most advanced translation and transformation tasks.

### Forums ###
FME community members post FME-related messages, ask questions, and share in answering other usersâ€™ questions. Members earn "reputation" and "badges," and there is a leaderboard of the top-participating users. Join the conversation to see how the community helps each other with their FME projects!

### Ideas Exchange ###
FME development is very much user-driven. The Ideas Exchange gives users the chance to post their ideas for new FME functionality, or improvements to existing functionality, and allows everyone to vote on the proposed ideas. The more votes an idea gets, the more likely it is to be implemented!
