# 2018 Overview #

FME Desktop 2018 introduces many new tools and functionality to both FME Workbench and the FME Data Inspector. These tools make wide-ranging changes to the methods workspace authors use in designing and creating workspaces.

## Top Tools ##
The most important new tools will be covered during this course. They are:

- **Caches and Partial Runs**
	- The ability for FME to cache data at each point of a translation, and to re-use that cached data.
- **Collapsible Bookmarks**
	- The ability for bookmarks to be collapsed to simple input/output ports, to hide the contents.
- **Precision and Tolerance Parameters**
	- The ability to set tolerance on a number of spatial operations, to work around coordinate precision differences.
- **Microsoft Formats**
	- The ability to write data to Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Word, and the addition of styling transformers for all Microsoft formats
- **FeatureJoiner**
	- A SQL-based transformer for carrying out joins in a more powerful version of the FeatureMerger


## Other Updates ##
Besides these top tools, it is also worth mentioning other highlights from the FME2018 release:
