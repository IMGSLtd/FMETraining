# Introduction to FME Desktop

## Overview

This course introduces the essential components and capabilities of FME through hands-on problem-solving exercises. It is a condensed version of the more in-depth FME Desktop Basic training and is a great start to become an efficient user of FME.

The course covers:
- Format Translations
- Transformation Tools
- Common Workflows

## Learning Objectives

- Learn what FME Desktop is and what it can do for you
- Convert data from one format to another using FME Workbench
- View and inspect data using the FME Data Inspector
- Manipulate data structure and content with transformers
- Work with multiple datasets in a single workspace
- Apply best practices to workspaces

## Prerequisites

- None

## Training Resources

To complete this training, you need a licensed version of FME Desktop installed. You can request a [free trial](https://www.safe.com/fme/fme-desktop/trial-download/) or may be eligible for a [grant license](https://www.safe.com/free-fme-licenses/). The training material is produced using FME Desktop 2019.0, but many of the steps are applicable to older versions.

You can download the data [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData2019.zip). After downloading, extract the data to C:\FMEData2019.
