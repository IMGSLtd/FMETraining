# Introduction to FME Desktop

## Overview

This course introduces the essential components and capabilities of FME through hands-on problem-solving exercises. It is a condensed version of the more in-depth FME Desktop Basic training and is a great start to become an efficient user of FME.

The course covers:
- Format Translations
- Transformation Tools
- Common Workflows

## Learning Objectives

- Learn what FME Desktop is and what it can do for you
- Convert data from one format to another using FME Workbench
- View and inspect data using the FME Data Inspector
- Manipulate data structure and content with transformers
- Work with multiple datasets in a single workspace
- Apply best practices to workspaces

## Prerequisites

- None

## Training Resources
