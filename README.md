# Data Integration with FME Desktop

This manual is an introductory-level training module for FME Desktop. It provides a framework for a basic understanding of FME and for using FME in data integration. While the scenario used is grounded in Geographic Information Systems for local government, urban planning, and administration, the skills are applicable to any use of FME. It has approximately four hours of content.

The module will introduce basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct them to resources to help apply the product to their own needs.

## Module Structure

The module is made up of three main sections. These sections are:

- Lecture
- Lab Demonstration
- Lab Exercises

The **Lecture** section is intended to be adapted by instructors to be taught in a classroom lecture. It covers conceptual issues of data integration and provides a high-level introduction to FME. [Slides](./fme-desktop-data-integration-slides.zip) are available.

The **Lab** section provides a walkthrough of how to use FME. It is designed to be presented by an instructor in a lab, with students either following along or independently completing the provided exercises.

Finally, the **Scenario-based Exercise** section provides a activities for students to complete during lab time or as an assignment.

[Lab questions](Integration3Scenario\3.03.LabQuestions.md) are provided; instructors may fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/jWeso3OY6RVe6PJG3) to request access to answers for grading.

## Module Audience

This module is aimed at a university or college student audience. FME sees a wide range of applications in any discipline that works with data, but is most commonly used in:

- Architecture
- Construction
- Engineering
- Forestry
- Geography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Oil & Gas
- Public Administration
- Telecommunications
- Urban Planning
- Utilities

Students should be comfortable with data manipulation software in a scripted or GUI environment. Prior knowledge of FME is not required. If the instructor wishes to adapt the module to a higher level, the lecture and lab demonstration content can be shortened.

## Module Length

The module's total length is approximately four hours. The lecture is approximately half an hour. The lab contains about two hours of walkthrough and exercises. Finally, the scenario-based exercise will take about an hour to complete. The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the module content in a different order and will skip or add new content to better customize the module to their needs. Therefore, the length and content of the module may vary.

## Adapting this Module

All of this content is provided for instructors to use, adapt, and remix for their own modules. Please note that this use does come with some legal caveats, explained in [About this Document](.\Integration0About\0.00.AboutThisDocument.md).

If you wish to change the content of the manual, you can fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/safesoftware/FMETraining/tree/FME-Desktop-Data-Integration-2018). The manual is created using the [GitBook toolchain](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/) and is written in easily editable [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). [Detailed instructions on adapting this content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N0XCvhYy2CP8x9qtANF0VKXAyK5GYMfaa6XPkyYcyi0/edit) are also available.

Some suggestions for adaptation:
- Localize the exercise data to your country or city. A list of open data portals is available [here](https://www.opendatasoft.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-all-open-data-portals-around-the-world/). You could also use [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data, which has good global coverage.
  - If you do change the data, feel free to modify your own [Module Resources](.\Integration0About\0.02.ModuleResources.md) page.
- If you prefer to grade close-ended questions, you could edit the final question in the scenario exercise. You could restrict the datasets or provide a data integration problem to solve rather then leaving it open for students to choose their data.
