## Server Authoring ##


### Introduction to FME Server ###

### Self Serve ###
- Mostly unchanged

### Real Time ###
- Reorganized but otherwise mostly unchanged

### Message Streams ###
- This chapter is comprised of content extracted from the previous Real-Time chapter
- This chapter replaces the automation section, the content of which has been moved into other chapters

### General ###
- Exercises are now numbered 1,2,3,etc within their particular chapter. A name (rather than number) denotes the chapter. This is because chapter numbers do not match the numbers GitBook assigns
- Improved (I hope) exercise descriptions and scenarios
- There are many more Q+A questions, all of which have the answers as the final section of their particular chapter
