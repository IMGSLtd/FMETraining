## FMEData

These changes are for the FMEData dataset that accompanies FME training

- Now host some of the FMEData data on the [Interopolis Open Data Portal](fme.ly/interopolis) for reading from the web in training

## Introduction to FME Desktop

### General

- Replaced the tip sections with FME Lizard tips.
- Q+A questions are now interactive in the HTML version of the manual
- Removed the Q+A answer page, since the answers are supplied with the question

### Getting Started

- The [What is FME? section](..\1.getting-started\1.02.what-is-fme.md) has been updated to discuss the FME data integration platform
- Added Visual Preview to the [FME Workbench section](..\1.getting-started\1.04.fme-workbench.md)

### Translations

- Inspecting is now done with Visual Preview primarily, with just one exercise using FME Data Inspector
- [Exercise 2.3](2.translations\2.07.ex2.3.md) now covers Sort Natural in Table View.

### Transformations

- Exercise 3.3a and b now cover looking for a join transformer, not a summary table creator

### Workflows

- Added a small section on reader and writer parameters
- Removed the fanout section and exercise
- Instead of writing out an HTML report, the final output is now joining a summary table to a KML file to view tabular data on a map

### Module Wrap-up
