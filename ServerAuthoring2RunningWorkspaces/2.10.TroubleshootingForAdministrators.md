## Workspaces Fail when Run ##

If a workspace fails when it is being run, then the following suggestions may help 

- Commonly data paths cause problems when moving from a local Desktop machine to a Server environment. Check the dataset parameters (Reader and Writer) to ensure they are not referring to a local path that does not exist on the Server. You may need to change the parameter to use the Resources dialog (Browse) and not a file path dialog (Specify Location).

- If you are trying to read data with a UNC path, ensure that the FME Server Windows Service is being run by a user with the proper domain access permissions.
