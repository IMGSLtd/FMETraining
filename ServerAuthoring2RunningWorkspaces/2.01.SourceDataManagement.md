# Source Data Management

Nearly every FME workspace starts by reading features from a source dataset.

In some cases that source dataset may be web-based, such as a real-time GeoJSON feed of earthquakes. On other occasions the data may not be web-based, but is stored in folders that are shared for others to access.

These scenarios make the task of authoring workspaces for much easier. Generally what works on FME Desktop can be published and run on FME Server without concern for the management of the source data.

However, most authors find it necessary to manage access to the source datasets, and there are various methods in FME Server that lets them do that:

- Database Connections
- Publishing Datasets
- Temporary Uploads
- Resources Folders
