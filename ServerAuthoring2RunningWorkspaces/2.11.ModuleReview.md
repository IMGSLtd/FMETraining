## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this module.

### Theory ###

- Some workspaces read data from a feed or shared folder and so can be uploaded to FME Server and used immediately. Others need source data to be managed to integrate with a Server workspace
- Databases can have a container of connection information created and stored on FME Server
- Data (and other related files) can be uploaded and stored on FME Server in various ways; either published data, temporary uploads, or as “Resources”
- Workspaces can be authored in FME Desktop specifically to use data stored in FME Server resource folders 
- Developer information is provided to help run workspaces via a URL
- Workspaces can be run in a series of translations using a technique called *chaining*
