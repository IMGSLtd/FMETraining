# Authoring Job Chains #

Workflow Management is a technique for controlling workspaces in sequence or branching with in-built logic. PArt of this technique is being able to author workspaces that are "chained together" to run one after another.

## What are Job Chains? ##

A chain of jobs is one that is run in sequence one after the other. There are various ways to implement this.

### The FeatureWriter Transformer ###
The easiest way to chain workspaces... is not to! A chain is often necessary because one workspace writes data that the next must then process. However, the FeatureWriter transformer allows data to be written and then further transformation to take place within the same workspace!

In the above workspace, data is validated and validation errors written out to a series of datasets according to the error type. These datasets are uploaded to Amazon S3 and a tweet sent to alert someone to the problems.

Without the FeatureWriter, such a project might have taken two or maybe three workspaces chained together. Here it only requires one.

The FeatureWriter transformer is new for FME2016, and advances the capabilities of FME Server by a huge amount. Further information is available in <a href="https://blog.safe.com/2016/01/fmeevangelist143/">this blog post</a> and in the <a href="http://www.safe.com/webinar/">FME2016 Deep Dive webinars</a> on the Safe web site.

### A Simple Chain ###

It's fairly simple to get one workspace to run another; all that is needed is a transformer or shutdown script to send the command. Given that each workspace in FME Server can be run using a URL, and that there is a REST API to do similarly, it's quite simple to run a HTTP command using a HTTPCaller transformer or a shutdown script.

Alternatively, an FMEServerJobSubmitter transformer can be used. This transformer triggers a workspace to run on FME Server.

In this workspace the results of the feature writer are sent as a single summary feature that triggers the FMEServerJobSubmitter. That transformer has parameters that allow the author to define another workspace on FME Server that should be run.

By adding this transformer to multiple workspaces a chain of almost any length can be created.

### A Parent-Child Approach ###
Instead of a chain of workspaces where one calls the next, a different approach is to have a control (parent) workspace that runs a series of (child) workspaces in turn.

Like in a simple chain, a master workspace runs other workspaces by using a transformer such as the FMEServerJobSubmitter.

Here a control workspace is using the FMEServerJobSubmitter to run three further FME workspaces. Maybe each workspace is a separate step in a database update process:

If a particular task fails then the output is routed to a text file Writer – meaning this could be used in a notification system to send an email to an administrator alerting them to the failure. Successfully executing all three results in a tweet being sent.

If there are several workspaces, but only one of which should be run, then the logic for deciding which one can be made using a Tester, or other filter transformer.

For example, here an organization runs a daily process to upload field updates into a database. Once a week it does the same, but also exports all files to Dropbox (for example):

![](./Images/Img2.31.ChainingWithJobSubmitterMasterTests.png)

The test is carried out by a Tester, and the daily/weekly processes are each defined in a separate workspace.

The Control Workspace may start with a Reader that reads a source dataset, where each source feature triggers the job submitter. For example, the source data may be a list of files that are to be translated.
<br><br>But more often just a single feature is needed to trigger the child process once. In this case a Creator transformer can be used instead of a Reader.
