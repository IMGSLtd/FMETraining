Clean up KML using feature caching?

# Partial Runs

Click on your reader feature type. Note that a tooltip appears above it with several icons. We used the "Open Containing Folder" icon earlier. You will also notice the next icon to the right allows you to open the data directly in Data Inspector. The next few icons are used for Partial Runs. These allow you to:

- "Run Just This": this option is only available on readers. It just runs the reader so you can use the cache.
- "Run To This": this option runs the workspace from any connected reader to this object.
- "Run From This": this option runs the workspace to any connected writers from this object.

IMAGES for each

Click "Run Just This" to run the reader and generate a cache. Since this reader does not have an error when it is run, after a few seconds it should have a green cache icon. Click that to open the data in Data Inspector:

This is a useful way to quickly inspect your data when beginning any translation.
