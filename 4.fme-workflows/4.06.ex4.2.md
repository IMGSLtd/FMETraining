Join

Clean up KML using feature caching

Could do join and/or fanout here instead.

# Exercise 4.2

{% import "../includes/templates.html" as template %}

{{ template.exercise(4.2,
               "Debugging with Feature Caching and Partial Runs",
               "3-1-1 case location details (`.xls` hosted on FTP)",
               "Use partial runs to debug a workspace<br>Join data using the FeatureMerger<br>Style a KML",
               "Incremental development and best practice",
               "None",
               "None")
}}

In order to get the summarized 3-1-1 data into our KML data, we have to join the data streams. We will use the FeatureMerger transformer to do that. Then we'll use partial runs to test our workspace incrementally. Finally, we'll style our KML using some format-specific transformers.

## 1) Join Data Streams using FeatureMerger

## 2) Use Partial Runs to Test

## 3) Style a KML using Format Attributes, the KMLPropertySetter, and the KMLStyler
