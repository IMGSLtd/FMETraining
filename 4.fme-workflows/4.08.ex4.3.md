Our workspace is getting complicated! We have two reader feature types, three writer feature types, and nine transformers. If one of your colleagues was to open this workspace, it would take them some time to figure out what exactly it was doing. Let's make their lives easier by following best practice, using bookmarks and annotations to comment on the workspace. This step is also friendly to future you: if you return to this workspace in the future, you will also be able to remember what it does by looking at the bookmarks and annotation.

## 1) Add Reader Bookmarks and Annotation

## 2) Add Writer Bookmarks and Annotation

## 3) Add Bookmarks to Transformation

## 4) Add Annotation to Transformation

## 5) Add Metadata

## 6) Upload to the FMEHub as template?
