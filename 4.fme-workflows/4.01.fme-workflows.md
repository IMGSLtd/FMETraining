# FME Workflows

## Learning Objectives
After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand how data flows through a workspace **using principles of visual programming**. [give multiple lenses here: *data integration platform* and then could give examples to help define further by using terms such as graphical user interface, perform ETL, visual programming etc.]
- Create a workspace with multiple formats.
- Create a workspace with multiple feature types.
- Use partial runs to debug your workspace.
- Employ best practice techniques in building your workspaces.

## Workflows

So far you have constructed basic workspace in FME is constructed and laid out strictly to the concept of ETL: Extract-Transform-Load.

However, there are multiple other methods for constructing more advanced workspaces, and for directing the flow of data through a workspace in unique ways.

Some example uses for these techniques might be:

- To branch your data into multiple streams
- To design large-scale workspaces a small section at a time
- To read data from multiple formats within a single workspace
- To carry out actions *after* a dataset has been written <!-- time for FR/FW? -->
- To use data stored on web services
- To test run individual parts of a workspace

In this unit we will cover some of these different FME workflows, illustrating the flexibility of FME for data transformation.
