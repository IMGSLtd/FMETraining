# Encrypting FME Server #


By default FME Server encrypts sensitive data in the FME Server Database, as well as passwords of FME Server configuration backups. There are, however, two enhancements that can be made to make this information even more secure.

### Generate your own encryption key ###
You may wish to enhance encryption security by generating your own custom encryption keys, which you can apply on a rotating basis. Any user with *Superuser* permission can generate a new encryption at any time.

<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">


Do not lose track of any custom keys you generate. Data that is encrypted under a lost key cannot be accessed. <br><br>

When performing a Backup & Restore of an FME Server configuration, you must restore to an FME Server that uses the same custom encryption key as the backup.

### Encrypting the FME Server Database Password ###
By default, the password that is stored in configuration file fmeCommonConfig.txt for the FME Server Database is not encrypted. To encrypt the FME Server Database password in fmeCommonConfig.txt, follow the steps in the [documentation.](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Server_Documentation/AdminGuide/Encrypt-FME-Server-Database-Password.htm)
