# HTTPS/SSL and FME Server #

HTTPS ensures that communication between the client and server is encrypted, so that if it is intercepted, the third party cannot easily view or use the information. For FME Server, you can use HTTPS to ensure that sensitive login information is not exposed.

When configuring FME Server for HTTPS, both Certification Authority (CA)-issued and self-signed certificates are supported.  Wildcard Certificates are also supported.

To configure this, please review the documentation for **[Configuring for HTTPS](https://docs.safe.com/fme/2019.1/html/FME_Server_Documentation/AdminGuide/configuring_for_https.htm)**.

Working with certificates can get complicated. If something goes wrong during or after the configuration, the tomcat log files are the place to look, or our **[Troubleshooting Guide](https://knowledge.safe.com/articles/49624/fme-server-and-https-troubleshooting-guide.html)** on the FME Community.
