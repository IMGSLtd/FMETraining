# Adding Engines #

Adding FME engines add to existing machines is a very simple process.

## 32- and 64-bit Engines ##

In some cases, you may want to install both 32- and 64-bit Engines on the same machine. For example, you may currently be running only 64-bit engines, but you want to run a workspace containing a format that is supported only on a 32-bit engine.

This configuration is permitted with FME Server and more details can be found in the FME Server Admin Documentation under **[Installing 32- and 64-bit Engines on the Same Machine](https://docs.safe.com/fme/2019.0/html/FME_Server_Documentation/AdminGuide/Install_32_and_64_Bit_Engines_On_Same_Machine.htm)**

An alternative to installing a different bit engine on the same system is to have a distributed FME Server system where you install the 32-bit engines and join this to the existing core system.  This requires performing a distributed installation, where the FME Engine is distributed onto a separate system.  Refer to the FME Server Admin Documentation for more information on Distributed Installations. [Distributed Installation](https://docs.safe.com/fme/2019.0/html/FME_Server_Documentation/AdminGuide/Distributed-Fault-Tolerant-Installation.htm)

Having both 32 and 64 bit engines on the same machine removes the ability to configure FME Engines on the "Engines & Licensing" page of the web interface. Run the same bit version of FME Engines unless absolutely necessary.

Use Job Queues to configure specific jobs to run on the new engine.  It is important to understand when installing different bit engines that it is necessary to direct the jobs to the correct engine.  A format that requires 32-bit engine must be directed to the 32-bit engine otherwise the job will fail when attempting to run on the 64-bit engine.  Making use of the Job Queue functionality will be key if you do decide to use mixed bit engines in your FME Server environment.
