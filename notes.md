# Notes

## Exercise skill progression

**New module**

1.1. Open and run workspace
2.1. Generate workspace (csv to xls or something)
2.2. Schema editing and mapping (do we still call it that? same skills)
2.3. Inspect data, including feature caches and workspace output (just diff data)
3.1. Finding transformers (just looking and adding one)
3.2. Common transformations (adding several)
4.1. Multiple readers and writers, including db and/or web. Adding FT. (no new trans)
4.2. Feature caching (example of error)
4.3. Bookmarks and annotations

**Getting Started currently**

Proposal: redo these for 2019.0 to align with training, switch inspect and transform

1. Generate workspace
2. Schema editing (and mapping w/o transformer)
3. Adding a transformer
4. Data Inspector (and feature caching)

## Questions

1. How frequently to have quizzes? Is once per unit too infrequent? Could try once per section instead. I think once per section with 2-5 questions might be about right. Trailhead does 1 ~5 question quiz per unit, which range from 5-30 minutes.
