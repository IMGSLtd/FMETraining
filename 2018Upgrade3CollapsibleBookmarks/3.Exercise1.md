The city maintenance department has a dataset of garbage collection schedules, to assign residents to collection on a particular day:

![](./Images/Img3.200.Ex1.ExistingZones.png)

However, because of shifting demographics and zoning changes, they have decided that new boundaries should be drawn. 

Your task is to use FME to create new boundaries. You must create five polygons, adjacent to each other, and with approximately the same number of residents in each. The analysis will be based on the city's address database. An estimate of the number of residents per address will be created depending on the zone type it falls within:

- Single-family residences: 2 adults
- Two-family residences: 4 adults
- Multi-family residences: 12 adults
- Comprehensive development zone: 8 adults
- Commercial properties: 1 adult

The output format shall be OGC GeoPackage.

To develop this workspace it's necessary to consider what different steps might be required. We can then create sections with a bookmark and fill them in as we go along.

<br>**1) Plan Workspace**
<br>Let's plan this workspace together.

First of all we need to read the address data (or a sample of it) and write the output to Shapefile.

We need to know which zone type each address falls inside; to do this needs zoning data to be read and a transformer to carry out a spatial join.

We need to create a resident count based on the zone type and then we need to divide the residents into five different areas.

Finally we need to group the addresses together and create a boundary shape around them. In short, we need this set of actions:

- Read/Sample Address database
- Read Zoning data
- Create a spatial join
- Calculate resident count
- Divide residents into five groups
- Aggregate the addresses into their group
- Create a boundary shape
- Write Shapefile

So, firstly generate a workspace to translate the following: 

<table style="border: 0px">

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Format</td>
<td style="">Esri Geodatabase (File Geodb Open API)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Reader Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2018\Data\Addresses\Addresses.gdb (PostalAddress table only)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Format</td>
<td style="">OGC GeoPackage</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="font-weight: bold">Writer Dataset</td>
<td style="">C:\FMEData2018\Output\Training\GarbageZones.gpkg</td>
</tr>

</table>

Once the workspace is generated, add bookmarks to it to represent the different steps required. As yet we can't be sure which sections will be larger, so they can all be the same size.


<br>**2) Original Workspace**
<br>You should now have a workspace that looks like this:

![](./Images/Img3.201.Ex1.StartingWorkspace.png)

If you used the predefined workspace, you'll also find a bookmark containing all of the transformers required for the exercise:

![](./Images/Img3.202.Ex1.RequiredTransformers.png)

Or at least, these are the transformers we think will be required for the exercise!


<br>**3) Sample Source Data**
<br>There are more features in the address database than we need for workspace construction and testing, so let's reduce that to a smaller sample.

Rather than create a test dataset, here we'll just use a Sampler transformer. So place a Sampler transformer into the Sample Addresses bookmark and connect the PostalAddress feature type to it:

![](./Images/Img3.203.Ex1.SamplerOnCanvas.png)

Inspect the Sampler's parameters. Set it to sample every 25th feature

![](./Images/Img3.204.Ex1.SamplerParams.png)

Add an Inspector transformer (to the Sampler:Sampled output port) and run the workspace to be sure it is sampling the data correctly. Out of 13,597 addresses, there should be 543 selected for use.


<br>**4) Divide Data into Groups**
<br>Before trying to add the Zoning dataset into the workspace, let's try and create groups from the basic dataset. This can be done with a custom transformer from the FME Hub, called the SpatialSorter.

Add a SpatialSorter transformer to the workspace and place it into the Divide Residents bookmark:

![](./Images/Img3.205.Ex1.SpatialSorterOnCanvas.png) 

The SpatialSorter sorts data spatially (so features closer geographically become closer in the sorted output) and creates groups.

Check the parameters for this transformer. Notice that the group parameter asks for a size, not number of groups. Therefore we'll need to calculate how many addresses there are when split into five groups.


<br>**5) Calculate Group Sizes**
<br>To calculate the number of addresses per group, we need the number of addresses and then divide that by five. We can do this with a combination of StatisticsCalculator and ExpressionEvaluator.

So, enlarge the Divide Residents bookmark as required and add a StatisticsCalculator and ExpressionEvaluator transformer. Connect them up to the Sampler:Sampled port like so:

![](./Images/Img3.206.Ex1.StatsExprOnCanvas.png)

 
<br>**6) Calculate Group Sizes**
<br>Inspect the parameters for the StatisticsCalculator. Pick an attribute for the Attributes to Analyze parameter; it can be any attribute, it doesn't matter which.

Under the Total Count Attribute parameter, enter the name TotalResidents:

![](./Images/Img3.207.Ex1.StatsCalcParams.png)

In the ExpressionEvaluator, enter GroupSize in the New Attribute parameter. In the Arithmetic Expression field enter the expression:

	@ceil((@Value(TotalResidents)/5))

![](./Images/Img3.208.Ex1.ExprEvalParams.png)

That expression will divide the number of residents into five groups, rounding up. Add an Inspector transformer to the ExpressionEvaluator and run the translation to prove this part works.


<br>**7) Group Residents**
<br>Now inspect the parameters for the SpatialSorter once more. Change the Grid Size to 256 to give a finer result. Under the Group Size parameter, click the drop-down arrow and select Attribute Value &gt; GroupSize:

![](./Images/Img3.209.Ex1.SpatialSorterParams.png)

This sets the group size to the attribute just calculated. 

To actually create groups of addresses, add an Aggregator transformer to the Group Residents bookmark, and connect it to the SpatialSorter:Sorted output port:

![](./Images/Img3.210.Ex1.AggregatorCanvas.png)

Inspect the parameters for the Aggregator. Set the Group By parameter to the GroupID attribute (created by the SpatialSorter):

![](./Images/Img3.211.Ex1.AggregatorParams.png)

Connect an Inspector (optionally set its Group By parameter to GroupID too) and run the translation. You should find their are five sets of point aggregates in the output, each of which has approximately the same number of point features:

![](./Images/Img3.212.Ex1.AggregatedResults.png)

Save the workspace as GarbageCollection-v1.fmw, or any similar name that includes a version number.

The next step in the workspace will be to add in the Zoning data, create a spatial join, and calculate how many residents live in each property based on each address' zoning type.
