# Lab

In this section of the module, the instructor can walk students through the basic functionality of FME Workbench and FME Data Inspector. Students can complete the included exercises using FME Workbench and FME Data Inspector. They are designed for students to complete in a lab with instructor supervision or on their own time as an assignment.

Refer to the [Lab Questions](..\Integration3Scenario\3.03.LabQuestions.md) as you complete the exercises. Note that these questions are separate from the knowledge check questions included in Introduction to FME Desktop.

The lab is delivered by Safe Software as a standalone training course, [Introduction to FME Desktop](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Intro-2019/index.html). [A recording of the course](https://www.safe.com/training/recorded/) is available.
