## System Cleanup ##

When FME Server is used heavily for a long period of time, a number of files can build up and use system resources. These files are either resource files (including multiple types of log file) or are job history records.

Both of these can be cleaned up using the tools under Manage &gt; Administration &gt; System Cleanup

Notice that there are multiple types of logs and results files that can be cleaned. Each of these entries represents a workspace stored in a repository called Utilities.
