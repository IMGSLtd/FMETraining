## Resources ##

FME Server has an inbuilt file management system that allows data, custom transformers, coordinate system definitions, and other miscellaneous files to be published to a Server instance and used within all Server operations.

This setup is called Resources and is accessed using Manage &gt; Resources from the web interface menu.

The resources home page looks like this:

Folders are opened by double-clicking on them in the interface.

This dialog used to be a tree view, with expandable folders showing files. However, this was changed in FME2016 to a flat display where each folder is accessed and displayed separately. That's because - with many hundreds of files - a tree view could become very, very lengthy, and very, very slow to display.

An individual folder in the Resources dialog looks like this:

![](./Images/Img1.35.ResourcesDataFolder.png)

Notice (highlighted) that this is the Data folder. It contains a single folder-based dataset called Zones. A number of buttons allow data to be downloaded, deleted, copied, or moved. 

The View File button opens a pop-up dialog in which a file is selected to preview. Note that, like this PDF, it must be viewable in a web browser:

The pop-up is closed by clicking the x button (highlighted).

In the main Resources window is also an option to upload files, or a folder of files. This can be used to upload any files that will be needed by a translation. This includes datasets, custom transformers, coordinate systems, custom formats.

Not just one, but two questions this time! 
<br>Firstly: I copy a workspace into a resources folder using the upload tool. What then?
<br><br>1. I can run it by browsing the resources, selecting the workspace, and clicking run 
<br>2. I can run it through the Manage &gt; Workspaces menu tools
<br>3. I can run it by calling it with the FMEServerJobSubmitter transformer in FME Desktop 
<br>4. I can't run it because it's not properly published to a repository
<br><br>Secondly: Uploading an entire folder of files come with what restriction?
<br><br>1. Folder upload only works on certain web browsers  
<br>2. Folder upload requires the folders to be zipped into a single file
<br>3. Folder upload only works on Windows C: drive (not D:, E:, etc)
<br>4. Folder upload requires FME Desktop to be installed on the computer being uploaded from
