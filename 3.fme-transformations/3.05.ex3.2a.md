In [Exercise 2.2](..\2.fme-translations\2.05.ex2.2.md), we found that some of our values for the `Local Area` attribute were inconsistent. In this exercise, you will use your new knowledge of transformer searching to find an appropriate transformer to address this problem. As we just covered, there are many options for searching for transformers. In this case, we need a transformer that can find specific text strings in an attribute and replace them with another value. Specifically, we want to find values of `Local Area` and replace them as such:

|Find|Replace|
|-|-|
|Dunbar Southlands|Dunbar-Southlands|
|Arbutus Ridge|Arbutus-Ridge|

Use the resources available (Transformer Gallery in Workbench, [Transformer Gallery online](https://www.safe.com/transformers/), the [FME Transformer Reference Guide](http://cdn.safe.com/resources/fme/FME-Transformer-Reference-Guide.pdf), and Quick Add search) to find such a transformer. Then, add it to your workspace after the Tester, edit its parameters, run your workspace, and inspect the results to ensure your changes were successful.

Ok, go for it! When you have found your solution, go to the next page to check your answer.
