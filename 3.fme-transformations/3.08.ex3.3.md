Your manager has some more requests for your workspace. The department wants to be able to provide a summary of the number of cases by department, by Local Planning Area. This summary table will help the city assess demand for different services in different areas of the city. In this exercise we will use some attribute transformers to generate a summary table.

# 1) Add an StatisticsCalculator

Add an StatisticsCalculator to your workspace after the Tester. The StatisticsCalculator takes incoming features and generates desired summary statistics, e.g. takes the mean (average) of a numeric attribute.

Your manager has asked for a summary of the number of cases by department, by local area. We will fill in the StatisticsCalculator parameters to get this information:

|Parameter|Value|
|-|-|
|Group By|`Department` and `Local Area`|
|Attributes to Analyze|`Case Type`|
|Total Count Attribute|`Cases`|

Additionally, make sure you remove the values from all the other Calculated Attributes (Minimum Attribute, Maximum Attribute, etc.). You can do this by selecting the parameter and deleting it with the <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key, or by clicking the dropdown arrow and selecting Clear Value:

When finished, your parameters should look like this:

With these parameters, the transformer will add an attribute, `Cases`, to your data, which sums the total number of 3-1-1 requests for each city department, for each local planning area.

<!-- explain group-by -->

Click Ok and use "Run To Here" on the StatisticsCalculator to summarize your data.

# 2) Inspect the Cache

Let's inspect the cache to ensure our data looks like we want it to. Click on the green inspect cache icon on the Summary output port of the StatisticsCalculator. The StatisticsCalculator illustrates that transformers vary in the number of input and output ports they have. Here the Summary port outputs a summary table of the results, essentially resulting in a new stream of features (here, 342), while the Complete and Cumulative ports add the results of the summary to every incoming feature (here, 97,325).

In the Data Inspector, you should see this in the Table View:

Now our CSV file will contain a summary table of 3-1-1 cases.
